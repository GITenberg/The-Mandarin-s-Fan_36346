<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Advertisement</span></h4>


<p>One July evening in the first year of the present
century, two gentlemen were seated on the terrace of
the mansion, known as Royabay. A small rose-wood
table was placed between the deep arm-chairs, and
thereon appeared wine, coffee, and a box of cigars. The
young host smoked a briar and sipped coffee, but his
guest, very wisely, devoted himself to superlative port
and a fragrant cigar. Major Tidman was a battered
old soldier of fortune, who appreciated good quarters
and made the most of civilised luxuries, when other
people paid for them. He had done full justice to a
dinner admirably cooked and served, while Ainsleigh,
the master of the feast had merely trifled with his
food. Now, the wary Tidman gave himself up to
the perfect enjoyment of wine, cigar and the quiet
evening, while his host restlessly changed his position
a dozen times in ten minutes and gloomed misanthropically
at the beautiful surroundings.</p>

<p>And these were very beautiful. From the moss-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>grown
terrace shallow steps descended to smooth
lawns and rainbow-hued flower-beds, and solemn
pines girdled the open space, wherein the house was
set. And under the radiance of a saffron coloured
sky, stood the house, grey with centuries of wind and
weather, bleaching sun and drenching rains. With
its Tudor battlements, casements, diamond-paned
and low oriel windows, half obliterated escutcheons;
its drapery of green ivy, and heavy iron-clamped
doors, it looked venerable, picturesque and peaceful.
Tennyson sang in the Palace of Art of just such a
quiet "English home the haunt of ancient peace."</p>

<p>On the left, the circle of trees receded to reveal the
majestic ruins of an abbey, which had supplied the
stones used to construct the mansion. Built by the
weak but pious Henry III., the Norman-French name
Royabbaye (King's Abbey) still designated the house
of the courtier who had obtained the monastery from
another Henry, less pious, and more prone to destroy
than to build. The country folk had corrupted the
name to Royabay, and its significance was almost
lost. But the owner of this fair domain knew its
meaning, and loved the ancient place, which had
been in the Ainsleigh family for over three hundred
years. And he loved it the more, as there was a
possibility of its passing away from him altogether.</p>

<p>Rupert was the last of the old line, poor in
relations, and poorer still in money. Till the reign
of George the first the Ainsleighs had been rich and
famous: but from the time of the Hanovarian advent
their fortunes declined. Charles Ainsleigh had
thrown in his lot with the unlucky Stewarts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
paid for his loyalty so largely as to cripple those
who succeeded him. Augustus, the Regency buck,
wasted still further the diminished property he inherited,
and a Victorian Ainsleigh proved to be just
such another spendthrift. Followed this wastrel,
Gilbert more thrifty, who strove, but vainly, to
restore the waning fortunes of his race. His son
Markham, endeavouring to acquire wealth for the
same purpose, went to the far East. But he died
in China,&mdash;murdered according to family tradition,&mdash;and
on hearing the news, his widow sickened and
died, leaving an only child to battle with the ancestral
curse. For a curse there was, as dire as
that which over-shadowed the House of Atreus, and
the superstitious believed,&mdash;and with much reason,&mdash;that
young Rupert as one of the Ainsleighs, had
to bear the burden of the terrible anathema.</p>

<p>Major Tidman knew all these things very well,
but being modern and sceptical and grossly material,
he discredited such occult influence. Expressing
his scornful surprise, that Rupert should trouble his
head about such fantasies, he delivered his opinion
in the loud free dictatorial speech, which was
characteristic of the bluff soldier. "Bunkum," said
the Major sipping his wine with relish, "because
an old monk driven to his last fortifications, curses
those who burnt him, you believe that his jabber
has an effect on the Ainsleighs."</p>

<p>"They have been very unlucky since," said
Rupert gloomily.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it&mdash;not a bit. The curse of Abbot
Raoul, didn't begin to work,&mdash;if work it did, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
I for one don't believe,&mdash;until many a long day after
this place came to your family. I was born in this
neighbourhood sixty and more years ago" added the
Major, "and I know the history of your family.
The Ainsleighs were lucky enough till Anne's reign."</p>

<p>"Till the first George's reign," corrected the
young man, "so far as money goes, that is. But
not one of them died in his bed."</p>

<p>"Plenty have died in their beds since."</p>

<p>"But have lost all their money," retorted Rupert.</p>

<p>"It's better to lose money than life," said Tidman
evasively.</p>

<p>"I'm not so certain of that Major. But you
should talk with Mrs. Pettley about Abbot Raoul's
curse. She believes in it."</p>

<p>"And you Ainsleigh?"</p>

<p>Rupert shrugged his shoulders. "We certainly
seem to be most unlucky," said he, declining to commit
himself to an opinion.</p>

<p>"Want of brains," snapped the Major, who was
one of those men who have a reason for everything,
"your people wasted their money, and refused to
soil their hands with trade. Such pig-headedness
brings about misfortune, without the aid of a silly
old fool's curse."</p>

<p>"I don't think Abbot Raoul was a fool," protested
the host mildly, "on the contrary, he is said to have
been a learned and clever man. Aymas Ainsleiyh,
received the abbey from Henry VIII., and burnt
Abbot Raoul in his own cloisters," he nodded towards
the ruins, "you can see the blackened square of
grass yonder, as a proof of the curse. Herbage will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
not grow there, and never will, till the curse be lifted."</p>

<p>"Huh," said the Major with supreme contempt,
"any chance of that?"</p>

<p>Rupert smiled. "A chance that will never occur I
fear. The curse, or prophecy, or whatever you like
to call it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I call it rubbish," interpolated the sceptic.</p>

<p>"Well doubting Thomas, it runs like this,&mdash;rude
enough verse as you will see, but you can't expect a
doomed man to be particular as to literary style,"
and Rupert recited slowly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My curse from the tyrants will never depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a sword in the hands of the angel flashes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Ainsleigh, poor, weds the poor maid of his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gold be brought forth from the holy ashes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I spare you the ancient pronunciation Major."</p>

<p>Tidman filled another glass with wine, and laughed
scornfully. "I expect the old monk made up the
second line to rhyme with ashes," he said expanding
his broad chest. "I've heard that rubbishy poetry
before. But haven't the Ainsleighs always married
poor girls?"</p>

<p>"Some did, but then they had money. It must
be a poor Ainsleigh to wed a poor girl to fulfil the
third line. My father and grandfather were both
poor, but they married rich brides."</p>

<p>"And what became of the cash?"</p>

<p>"It went&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;but it went."</p>

<p>"Gold turns to dry leaves in the hands of fools,"
said Tidman sagely, "there's some sense in the old
fairy tales. But the fourth line? how can you get
gold from ashes?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Ainsleigh rose and began to pace the
terrace. "I'm sure I don't know," he said, "that's
the curse. If I marry Miss Rayner, I certainly
fulfil the third line. She is poor and I am a pauper.
Perhaps when the enigma of the third line is solved
by such a marriage the fourth line will be made clear."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't hang on to that poetry if I were you,
Ainsleigh. Let some one else solve the third line,
and the fourth also if he likes. My advice to you is
to marry a dollar heiress."</p>

<p>Rupert looked savage. "I love Miss Rayner, and
I marry her, or no one."</p>

<p>Tidman selected another cigar carefully. "I think
you are wrong," said he decisively, "you have only
a small income it's true, but you have this grand
old place, a fine old name, and you ain't bad-looking.
I guess Miss Jonathan of N'Yr'k would just jump
at you."</p>

<p>"I love Olivia Rayner," repeated Ainsleigh
doggedly.</p>

<p>"But the obstacles my dear Don Quixote," argued
the Major lighting the cigar, "you are poor and
she, at the most, will inherit only a few hundreds a
year from that aunt of hers. And that mass of
granite Miss Wharf, don't like you, nor does her
companion, the Pewsey cat."</p>

<p>"Why do you call her a cat&mdash;the harmless
creature."</p>

<p>"Because she <i>is</i> a cat," said Tidman sturdily,
"she'd scratch if she got a chance for all her velvet
paws. But she hates you as old Miss Wharf does.
Then there's Lady Jabe&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh heavens," said Rupert and made a wry face.</p>

<p>"You may well say that. She's a bullying
Amazon of uncertain age. But she'll do her best to
catch Olivia for her nephew Chris Walker."</p>

<p>"Oh he's a nice enough fellow," said Rupert still
pacing the terrace. "I've got nothing to say against
him, except that he'd better keep out of my way.
And after all Olivia would never marry a clerk in a
tea merchant's firm."</p>

<p>"But he's nephew to Lady Jabe."</p>

<p>"What of that. She's only the widow of a knight
and hasn't a penny to leave him. Why should she
want him to marry Olivia?"</p>

<p>"Because Miss Wharf will leave Olivia five
hundred a year. Lady Jabe will then live on the
young couple. And see here Ainsleigh, if you marry
Olivia with that income, you won't be taking to wife
the poor girl mentioned in the curse."</p>

<p>"Oh hang the curse," said Rupert crossly.</p>

<p>"By all means," said Tidman serenely, "you didn't
bring me here to talk of that did you?"</p>

<p>"No. I want to ask your advice?"</p>

<p>"I've given it&mdash;unasked. Marry a dollar-heiress,
and let old Jabe make Olivia her niece-in-law. By
doing so you will be released from your pecuniary
difficulties, and will also escape the hatred of Miss
Wharf and that Pewsey cat, who both hate you."</p>

<p>"I wonder why they do?"</p>

<p>"Hum," said Tidman discreetly. He knew pretty
well why Miss Wharf hated his host, but he was too
wise to speak, "something to do with a love affair."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ask me another," replied Major Tidman vulgarly,
for he was not going to tell a fiery young man like
Rupert, that Markham Ainsleigh, Rupert's father,
was mixed up in the romance, "and I wish you
would sit down," he went on irritably "you're walking
like a cat on hot bricks. What's the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter," echoed Ainsleigh returning
to the <ins title="Originally had an extraneous quote.">arm-chair.</ins>
"I asked you here to tell you."</p>

<p>"Wait till I have another glass. Now fire ahead."
But Rupert did not accept the invitation immediately.
He looked at the lovely scene spread out before him,
and up to the sky which was now of a pale primrose
colour. There was a poetic vein in young Ainsleigh,
but troubles from his earliest childhood had stultified
it considerably. Ever since he left college had he
battled to keep the old place, but now, it seemed as
if all his trouble had been in vain. He explained his
circumstances to the Major, and that astute warrior
listened to a long tale of mortgages threatened to be
foreclosed, of the sale of old and valuable furniture,
and of the disposal of family jewels. "But this last
mortgage will finish me," said Rupert in conclusion.
"I can't raise the money to pay it off. Miss Wharf
will foreclose, and then all the creditors will come
down on me. The deluge will come in spite of all
I can do."</p>

<p>Major Tidman stared. "Do you mean to say that
Miss Wharf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She holds the mortgage."</p>

<p>"And she hates you," said Tidman, his eyes
bulging, "huh! This is a nice kettle of fish."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert threw himself back in the deep chair with an
angry look. He was a tall finely built young man
of twenty-five, of Saxon fairness, with clear blue eyes
and a skin tanned by an out-door life. In spite of
his poverty and perhaps because of it, he was accurately
dressed by a crack London tailor, and looked
singularly handsome in his well-fitting evening suit.
Pulling his well-trimmed fair moustache, he eyed
the tips of his neat, patent leather shoes gloomily,
and waited to hear what the Major had to say.</p>

<p>That warrior ruminated, and puffed himself out
like the frog in the fable. Tidman was thickset and
stout, bald-headed and plethoric. He had a long
grey moustache which he tugged at viciously, and
on the whole looked a comfortable old gentleman,
peaceful enough when let alone. But his face was
that of a fighter and his grey eyes were hot and
angry. All over the world had the Major fought,
and his rank had been gained in South America.
With enough to live on, he had returned to the cot
where he was born, and was passing his declining
days very pleasantly. Having known Rupert for
many years and Rupert's father before him, he
usually gave his advice when it was asked for, and
knew more about the young man's affairs than anyone
else did. But the extent of the ruin, as revealed
by the late explanation, amazed him. "What's to
be done?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's what I wish you to suggest," said Rupert
grimly, "things are coming to a climax, and perhaps
when the last Ainsleigh is driven from home,
Abbot Raoul will rest quiet in his grave. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
ghost walks you know. Ask Mrs. Pettley. She's
seen it, or him."</p>

<p>"Stuff-stuff-stuff," grumbled the Major staring,
"let the ghost and the curse and all that rubbish
alone. What's to be done?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the young man meditatively, "either
I must sell up, and clear out to seek my fortune,
leaving Olivia to marry young Walker, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?" asked Tidman seeing Rupert
hesitating.</p>

<p>For answer Ainsleigh took a pocket-book from
the lower ledge of the table and produced therefrom
a slip of printed paper.</p>

<p>"I cut that out of "The Daily Telegraph," said
he handing it to the Major, "what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>Tidman mounted a gold pince-nez and read aloud,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The jade fan of Mandarin Lo-Keong, with the
four and half beads and the yellow cord. Wealth
and long life to the holder, who gives it to Hwei,
but death and the doom of the god Kwang-ho to
that one who refuses. Address Kan-su at the Joss-house
of the Five Thousand Blessings, 43 Perry
Street, Whitechapel."</p>

<p>"A mixture of the Far East and the Near West,
isn't it?" asked Rupert, when the Major laid down
the slip and stared.</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong," said Tidman searching his memory,
"wasn't that the man your father knew?"</p>

<p>"The same. That is why I cut out the slip, and
why I asked you to see me. You remember my
father's expedition to China?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course. He went there twenty years ago
when you were five years of age. I was home at
the time&mdash;it was just before I went to fight in that
Janjalla Republic war in South America. I wanted
your father to come with me and see if he couldn't
make money: but he was bent on China."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rupert, "I understood he knew of
a gold-mine there."</p>

<p>"Yes, on the Hwei River," Major Tidman
snatched the slip of print and read the lines again,
"and here's the name, Hwei&mdash;that's strange."</p>

<p>"But what's stranger still," said Rupert, bending
forward, "is, that I looked up some papers of my father
and learn that the Hwei River is in the Kan-su
province."</p>

<p>"Address Kan-su," murmured Tidman staring
harder than ever. "Yes. It seems as though this
had something to do with your father."</p>

<p>"It <i>must</i> have something to do with him," insisted
Rupert, "my father found that gold-mine near the
Hwei River in the Kan-su province, and Lo-Keong
was the Boxer leader who protected my father from
the enmity of the Chinese. I believe he sent my
father's papers to England&mdash;at least so Dr. Forge
says."</p>

<p>"Forge," cried Tidman rising, "quite so. He
was with your father. Why not see him, and ask
questions."</p>

<p>"I'll do so. Perhaps he may tell me something
about this fan."</p>

<p>"What if he does?"</p>

<p>"I might find it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if you do?" asked the Major, his eyes
protruding.</p>

<p>Rupert sprang to his feet and took up the slip.
"Wealth and long life to the holder who gives it
to Hwei," he read: then replaced the slip in his
pocket-book, "why shouldn't I find that fan and get
enough money to pay off Miss Wharf and others and
keep Royabay."</p>

<p>"But it's such a mad idea?"</p>

<p>"I don't see it. If it hadn't to do with my father
it would be," said Ainsleigh lighting his pipe, "but
my father knew Lo-Keong, and by the names Hwei
and Kan-su, it seems as though the locality of the
gold-mine had something to do with the matter.
I'll see old Forge and try to find this fan." "Oh,"
said Tidman, a light breaking on him, "you think
Lo-Keong may have given the fan to your father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Forge may know what luggage and
papers were sent home, at the time my father
died&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was murdered you mean."</p>

<p>"We can't be sure of that," said Rupert his face
flushing, "but I'll find that out, and get hold of the
fan also. It's my chance to make money, and I
believe Providence has opened this way to me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dr. Forge</span></h4>


<p>Royabay was distant five miles from Marport, a
rising watering place on the Essex coast. In fact
so large was the town, and so many the visitors, that
it might be said to be quite risen, though the inhabitants
insisted that it had not yet attained the height
it yet would reach. But be this as it may, Marport
was popular and fashionable, and many retired
gentlepeople lived in spacious houses along the cliffs
and in the suburbs. The ancient town, which lay
in a hollow, was left to holiday trippers, and these
came in shoals during the summer months. There
was the usual pier, the Kursaal, the theatre, many
bathing machines and many boarding houses&mdash;in fact
the usual sort of things which go to make up a
popular watering-place. And the town had been in
existence&mdash;the new part at all events&mdash;for only fifteen
years. Like Jonah's gourd it had sprung up in a
night: but it certainly showed no signs of withering.
In fact its attractions increased yearly.</p>

<p>Major Tidman was a wise man, and had not
travelled over the world with his eyes shut. He had
seen colonial towns spring up and fade away, and
knew how the value of land increases. Thus, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
he returned to his own country with a certain sum
of money, he expended the same in buying land, and
in building thereon. This policy produced a lot of
money, with which the Major bought more land and
more houses. Now, he possessed an avenue of desirable
villa residences in the suburbs which brought
him in a good income, and which, by reason of their
situation, were never empty. The Major did not
live here himself. He was a bachelor and fond of
company: therefore he took up his quarters in the
Bristol Hotel, the most fashionable in Marport. As
he had shares in the company which built it, he managed
to obtain his rooms at a comparatively moderate
rate. Here he lived all the year round, save when he
took a trip to the Continent, and, as the Bristol was
always full of people, the Major did not lack company.
As he was a good-humoured little man, with plenty
of small talk and a fund of out-of-the-way information,
he soon became immensely popular. In this way
the crafty Major had all the comforts of home and
the delights of society without bearing the burden of
an establishment of his own. His sole attendant was
a weather-beaten one-eyed man, who acted as his
valet, and who knew how to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Major would walk up town and
inspect his property with great pride. It was balm
to his proud heart to walk up and down the spacious
avenue, and survey the red brick villas smiling amidst
trim gardens. Tidman's birth was humble,&mdash;his
father had been a small tenant farmer of the Ainsleighs,&mdash;and
he had started life without even the proverbial
shilling. For many years he was absent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
his native land, and returned to find fortune waiting
for him on the door step. To be sure he brought a
nest-egg home with him. Nevertheless, but for his
astuteness in buying land and in building he would
not have acquired such a good income. So the Major
had some cause for self congratulation, when he
paced up and down Tidman's Avenue.</p>

<p>Two days after his dinner with Rupert Ainsleigh,
the Major spick and span as usual,&mdash;he always looked
as though he had stepped out of a bandbox,&mdash;was
strutting up the Avenue. Half way along he came
face to face with a withered little woman, who looked
like the bad fairy of the old nursery tales. She wore
a poke bonnet, a black dress and, strange to say, a
scarlet shawl. Her age might have been about fifty-five,
but she looked even older. With her dress
picked up, and holding a flower in her hand, she came
mincing along smiling at the world with a puckered
face and out of a pair of very black and brilliant eyes.
She looked a quaint old-fashioned gentlewoman of
the sort likely to possess a good income, for it seemed
that no pauper would have dared to dress in so shabby
and old-fashioned a manner. Consequently it was
strange that the gallant Major should have showed a
disposition to turn tail when he set eyes on her. She
might indeed have been the veritable witch she looked,
so pale turned Major Tidman's ruddy face. But the
old dame was not going to let him escape in this way.</p>

<p>"Oh good morning," she said in a sharp voice like
a saw, "how well you are looking dear Major Tidman&mdash;really
so very well. I never saw you look younger.
The rose in your button-hole is not more blooming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
How do you keep your youth so? I remember you&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Major cut her short. He had enough of
flattering words which he guessed she did not mean,
and didn't want her to remember anything, for he
knew her memory extended disagreeably to the time
when he had been a poor and humble nobody. "I'm
in a hurry Miss Pewsey" he said twirling his stick,
"good-morning ma'am&mdash;morning."</p>

<p>"If you're going to see Dr. Forge," said Miss
Pewsey, her black eyes glittering like jet. "I've
just come from his house. He is engaged."</p>

<p>"I can wait I suppose, Miss Pewsey," said Tidman
bristling, "that is, supposing I am calling on the
doctor."</p>

<p>"Then you really are: not on account of your
health I'm sure. I do hope you aren't ill, dear Major.
We all look forward to you shining at the ball, which
is to take place at the Hotel Bristol."</p>

<p>"I may be there, Miss Pewsey. I may be there,&mdash;in
fact," the Major flourished his stick again, "I
am one of the stewards."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey clapped together a pair of small
claws encased in shabby cotton gloves. "There,"
she cried in a shriller voice than ever. "I knew it.
I said so to my Sophia. Of course you know I
always call dear Miss Wharf my Sophia; we have
been friends for years&mdash;oh yes, for years. We grew
on one stem and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me, ma'am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;I know you are so busy. But I was
saying, that you can give me a ticket for my nephew,
Mr. Burgh&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"The tickets are for sale at the hotel," said Tidman
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but my poor nephew is poor. He also has
come from foreign parts Major as you did, and just
as poor. You must give him a ticket&mdash;oh really you
must." Miss Pewsey spoke with an emphasis on
every other word, and between her teeth as though
she was trying to prevent the speech escaping too
rapidly. "Now, Major," she coaxed.</p>

<p>"I'll see, ma'am&mdash;I'll see."</p>

<p>"Oh. I knew you would." She clasped her
hands again, "come and see my Sophia&mdash;dear Miss
Wharf, and then you can give Clarence&mdash;that's my
nephew's name, sweet isn't it?&mdash;you can give him
the ticket. But don't bring <i>him</i>," added Miss
Pewsey jerking her old head backward in the direction
of Dr. Forge's residence, "he's there."</p>

<p>"Who is there, ma'am?" demanded the Major
with a start.</p>

<p>"Why that horrid Mr. Ainsleigh and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey got no further. The Major uttered
something naughty under his breath, and taking off
his hat with a flourish, bowed his way along the road,
pursued by the shrill injunctions of the lady not to
forget the ticket.</p>

<p>Tidman walked more rapidly and less jauntily than
usual, and stopped at Dr. Forge's gate to wipe his
red face, which had now assumed its normal colour.</p>

<p>"By George" said the old soldier, "that woman
will marry me, if I don't take care. She ain't safe&mdash;she
shouldn't be allowed out. Pewsey&mdash;a cat&mdash;a
cat&mdash;I always said so. Lavinia Pewsey cat, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Benjamin Tidman gentleman. Not if I know it&mdash;ugh&mdash;ugh,"
and he walked up the steps to ring the
bell. While waiting, his thoughts went from Miss
Pewsey to Rupert. "I thought he had gone to town
about that fan business," said the Major fretting,
"what's he doing calling on Forge without telling
me," and Tidman seemed very much annoyed that
Rupert should have taken such a liberty.</p>

<p>True enough, he found young Ainsleigh sitting
with Dr. Forge. The doctor was a tall lean man
with sad eyes, and a stiff manner. He was dressed
in a loose white flannel suit, in a most unprofessional
way. But everyone knew that Forge had money and
did not practise, save when the fancy took him.
With his watchful grey eyes and sad face and lantern
jaws, Forge was not a prepossessing object or a
medical attendant to be desired. Also his hands had
a claw-like look, which, added to his thin hooked nose,
made him look like a hawk. He spoke very little
though, and what he did say was to the point: but he
was not popular like the Major. A greater contrast
than this mummy and handsome young Ainsleigh,
can scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>The Major came puffing into the room and looked
around. It was a small apartment furnished with
Chinese curiosities. Rice-paper painted in the conventional
Chinese fashion adorned the walls: a many-tasseled
lantern gay with colour, dangled from the
roof, and in each corner of the room a fat mandarin
squatted on a pedestal. The furniture was of bamboo,
and straw matting covered the floor. A bookcase
filled with medical volumes looked somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
out of place in this eastern room, as did the doctor's
writing table, a large one covered with papers and
books, and strange looking Chinese scrips. The room
was as queer as its owner, and the atmosphere had
that indescribable eastern smell, which the Major remembered
to have sniffed up at Canton under disagreeable
circumstances. Perhaps it was the revival
of an unpleasant memory that made him sit down so
suddenly, or it might have been the cold grey stony
eyes of Forge.</p>

<p>"Well Major," said Rupert who looked handsome
and gay in flannels, and who seemed to have lost his
melancholy looks, "who would have thought of seeing
you here?"</p>

<p>"I came to ask Forge to keep the exterior of his
house a little more tidy," said the Major with dignity,
"the steps have not been cleaned this morning, and
there is straw in the garden, while the shrubs and
flowers are dying for want of water."</p>

<p>Forge shrugged his thin shoulders, and nodded towards
some egg-shell china cups and a quaint looking
tea-pot. But he did not speak.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Major to the silent invitation.
"I never drink tea in the afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or at any time," said Forge in a melancholy
way. "I know you of old. Ainsleigh, take another
cup."</p>

<p>"Not in the Chinese fashion," said Rupert smiling,
"you drink it too hot for my taste and I like milk
and sugar. But now I've told you about the fan, I'll
leave you to chat with Tidman."</p>

<p>"The fan," said Tidman sitting up as straight as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
his stoutness would let him, "ah yes&mdash;I forgot about
that. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," echoed Rupert lighting a cigarette, "I
called at the joss house in Perry Street Whitechapel,
and a nice sort of den it is. A Chinaman, heard my
explanation about my father's connection with
Lo-Keong, and then told me that the fan had been
stolen from that gentleman, who is now a Mandarin."</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong was well on the way to the highest
post when I saw him last" said Forge preparing a
roll of tobacco, "he was much in favour at the court."</p>

<p>"But I thought he was a Boxer," said Tidman,
"and surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh he gave up the Boxers, and curried favour with
the Dowager Empress. That was seven years ago,
when I was last in China. I met you there Tidman."</p>

<p>Again the disagreeable recollection of Canton
crossed the Major's memory, and he nodded.
"What about the fan?" he asked Rupert again.</p>

<p>"It's of great value," said Ainsleigh, "at least this
Chinaman told me so. Lo-Keong is now a Mandarin,
and is high in favour with the Dowager Empress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And consequently is hated by the Emperor,"
murmured Forge.</p>

<p>"I don't know, doctor, I'm not up in Chinese
politics. However, the fan was lost by Lo-Keong
some years ago, and being a sacred fan, he wants it
back. This Chinaman Tung-Yu&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Major, "then you didn't see Hwei
or Kan-su?"</p>

<p>"Those are names of a river and a province," said
the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"I know," snapped Tidman, "but they were in
the advertisement."</p>

<p>"Tung-yu explained that they were used only for
the purpose of advertisement," said Rupert, "but to
make a long story short, I told him that I had seen
the fan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You saw the fan," asked Tidman directing a side
look at Forge.</p>

<p>"A dream&mdash;a dream," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"No," insisted the young man. "I feel sure I
have seen that fan, I can't think where. Perhaps it
is amongst my father's effects sent from China by
Lo-Keong years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago," said Dr. Forge, "and Lo-Keong
would hardly send his own fan. I remember
the things coming. I came home immediately
before. A Chinaman brought your father's
papers and luggage to Royabay. He left them with
your mother and went away."</p>

<p>"Were you not with my father when he died?"
asked Rupert, "I always understood you were."</p>

<p>"No. I was at Pekin at the time. Your father
and I were working the mine together, and I went
about some imperial concessions. While there I
heard that your father was dead."</p>

<p>"Was he murdered?" asked Rupert earnestly.</p>

<p>"I really can't say, Lo-Keong said that he died
of dysentery, but he was always a liar. He wouldn't
be so high in favour with the Court if he wasn't.
Lying is a fine art in the Far East, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Yes," said Tidman impatiently, "but what
has all this to do with the fan?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it's all of a piece myself," said Rupert,
"and I intend to get to the bottom of it. I have seen
that fan somewhere&mdash;but I can't think&mdash;I can't," he
reflected and shook his head, "no. But I have seen
it doctor, so its no use your shrugging your shoulders.
I want to find it and get that five thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the Major leaping up on his stout
little legs.</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong is willing to give five thousand pounds
for the return of his fan," said Ainsleigh, who had
walked to the door, "and I intend to earn it."</p>

<p>"Against my advice," said Forge looking up oddly.</p>

<p>Rupert laughed. "Oh you are afraid," he said
smiling.</p>

<p>"Of you, not of myself. I know what the Chinese
are, and have studied the race for years. I know
how to deal with them; but you will get into trouble
if you meddle with this fan business."</p>

<p>"And so I say," cried Tidman emphatically.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you know of the Chinese, Major?"
asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"More than I like to think of," said the little
man wiping his bald head. "I went out to China
for a trip seven years ago and met with an adventure
in Canton&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p>"What sort of an adventure?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the Major again, "don't talk
about it. It makes me cold to think of it. The
Chinese are demons. Forge got me out of the trouble
and I left China never to set foot in it again I hope.
Ainsleigh, if you want that curse of yours to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
realised, meddle with the fan. But if you want to
keep your life and your skin, leave the matter alone."</p>

<p>"I'm going to get that five thousand pounds,"
said Rupert, obstinately, "as soon as I can recollect
where I saw that fan. The memory will come back
to me. I am sure it will. Doctor you won't help me."</p>

<p>"No," said Forge decisively. "I advise you to
leave the matter alone."</p>

<p>"In that case I must search it out myself. Good-day,"
and Ainsleigh strolled out of the room, lightheartedly
enough, as he whistled a gay tune. Major
Tidman looked grimly at the closed door, and then
still more grimly at the doctor, who was paring his
nails.</p>

<p>"Our young friend is ambitious," he said.</p>

<p>Forge laughed gently. "You can hardly blame
him. He wants to marry Miss Rayner and save
his ancestral home, so I am quite sure he will search
for the fan."</p>

<p>"He won't find it then," said the Major petulantly.</p>

<p>"Won't he?" questioned Forge sweetly, "well,
perhaps not. By the way you want to see me
Major. Mrs. Bressy tells me you called at least
twice yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes. She didn't know when you would be back."</p>

<p>"I never tell her. I like to take the old lady unawares.
She is a Dickens' character, with a fondness
for drink, and for taking things which don't belong to
her. I always go away and come back unexpectedly.
Yesterday I was in Paris. Now I am at Marport.
Well?"</p>

<p>The Major had contained himself with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
all this time, and had grown very red in the face.
The colour changed to a lively purple, as he
burst out. "See here Forge what's the use of
talking to me in this way. You have that fan."</p>

<p>"Have I," said Forge smiling gently.</p>

<p>"Yes. You know well enough that the very fan&mdash;the
jade fan with the five beads, was the cause of
my getting into trouble in Canton. You got me
out of the trouble and you asked me to give you the
fan, when I thanked you."</p>

<p>"And you refused," said Forge still smiling.</p>

<p>"Well I did at first," said Tidman sulkily. "I
risked my life over the beastly thing, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Forge raised a thin hand. "Spare yourself the
recital. I know."</p>

<p>"Well then," went on Tidman excitedly. "You
asked again for it when you came home, and I gave
it to you. Ainsleigh is quite right. He <i>did</i> see the
fan. I showed it to him one day before you arrived.
I see he has forgotten, but any stray thought may
revive his memory. I don't want him to have the fan."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Forge shutting his knife with
a click.</p>

<p>"Because I want the five thousand pounds for
myself. I'm not so well off as people think, and I
want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget," said Forge gently, "you gave me
the fan."</p>

<p>"And have you got it?"</p>

<p>"I have," he nodded towards a cabinet of Chinese
work adorned with quaint figures, "it's in there."</p>

<p>"Give it to me back."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I think I'll keep it."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do with it?" asked Tidman
angrily.</p>

<p>Forge rose and looked stern, "I want to keep it
from Lo-Keong," he said savagely, "there's some
secret connected with that fan. I can't understand
what the secret is or what the fan has to do with it:
but it means life and death to this Mandarin. He'd
give ten thousand,&mdash;twenty thousand to get that
fan back. But he shan't."</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned the Major, "why did I give it to
you. To think that such a lot of money should go
begging. If I had only known what the fan was
worth."</p>

<p>"You knew nothing about it save as a curiosity."</p>

<p>"How do you know," demanded the Major.</p>

<p>Forge who had turned towards the cabinet wheeled
round and looked more like a hawk than ever as he
pounced on the stout man. "What do <i>you</i> know?"
and he clawed Tidman's plump shoulders.</p>

<p>"Let me go confound you," blustered the Major,
"what do you mean by assaulting a gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A gentleman." Forge suddenly released the
Major and laughed softly, "does Benjamin Tidman,
old Farmer Tidman's son call himself so. Why I
remember you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes I know you do, and so does that infernal
Pewsey cat."</p>

<p>Forge suddenly became attentive. "Miss Pewsey
if you please. She is my friend. I may&mdash;" Forge
halted and swallowed something. "I may even
marry her some day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"What," shouted Tidman backing to the wall,
"that old&mdash;old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gently my good Benjamin, gently."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you're not a marrying man."</p>

<p>"We never know what we are till we die," said
Forge turning again towards the black cabinet, "but
you needn't mention what I have said. If you do,"
Forge snarled like an angry cat and shot one glance
from his gray eyes that made Tidman shiver: then
he resumed his gentle tone. "About this fan. I'll
make a bargain with you."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the Major avariciously.</p>

<p>"I'll show you the fan, and if you can guess it's
secret, I'll let you give it to this Tung-yu or Hwei or
Kan-su or whatever he likes to call himself."</p>

<p>"But you don't want Lo-Keong to have the fan,"
said the Major doubtfully.</p>

<p>Forge opened the cabinet slowly. "So long as I
learn the secret he can have the fan. I want to
ruin him. He's a devil and&mdash;ah&mdash;" he started back.
"The fan&mdash;the fan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Tidman, craning over Forge's
shoulder at an empty drawer, "where is the fan?"</p>

<p>"Lost," cried Forge furiously, and looked like a
dangerous grey rat.</p>

<p>"Five thousand pounds gone," moaned the
Major.</p>

<p>"My life you fool&mdash;my life," cried the doctor, "it
is at stake."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Miss Wharf at Home</span></h4>


<p>The best houses in Marport were situated on the
Cliffs. They stood a considerable way back and had
small plots of ground before them cultivated or not,
according to the taste of those who owned them.
Some of these gardens were brilliant with flowers,
others had nothing but shrubs in them, presenting
rather a sombre appearance, and a few were bare
sun-burnt grass plots, with no adornment whatsoever.
A broad road divided the gardens from the
grassy undulations of the cliffs, and along this
thoroughfare, rolled carriages, bicycles, and motor-cars
all day during the season. Then came the grass on
the cliff-tops which stretched for a long distance, and
which was dotted with shelters for nervous invalids.
At one end there was a round bandstand where red-coated
musicians played lively airs from the latest
musical comedy. Round the stand were rows of chairs
hired out at twopence an afternoon, and indeed, all
over the lawns, seats of various kinds were scattered.
At the end of the grass, the cliffs sloped gradually
and were intersected with winding paths, which led
downward to the asphalt Esplanade which ran along
the water's edge, when the tide was high, and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>side
evil-smelling mud when the tide was out. And
on what was known as the beach&mdash;a somewhat
gritty strand,&mdash;were many bathing machines. Such
was the general appearance of Marport which the
Essex people looked on as a kind of Brighton, only
much better.</p>

<p>Miss Sophia Wharf owned a cosy little house at
the far end of the cliffs, and just at the point where
Marport begins to melt into the country. It was a
modern house comfortably furnished and brilliant
with electric lights. The garden in front of it was
well taken care of, there were scarlet and white
shades to the windows and flower boxes filled with
blossoms on the sills. Everyone who passed remarked
on the beauty of the house, and Miss Wharf was always
pleased when she heard them envy her
possessions. She liked to possess a Naboth's Vineyard
of her own, and appreciated it the more, when
others would have liked to take it. She had an income
of one thousand a year and therefore could live
very comfortably. The house (Ivy Lodge was it's
highly original name) was her own, bought in the
days when Marport was nothing but a fishing village.
She knew everyone in the neighbourhood, was a
staunch friend to the vicar who was high church and
quite after her own heart in the use of banners, incense,
candles and side-altars, and on the whole was
one of the leading ladies of the place. She had the
reputation of being charitable, but this was owing to
Miss Pewsey who constantly trumpeted the bestowal
of any stray shilling being by her patroness.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf was a lady of good family, but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
quarrelled with her relatives. She was a tall, cold,
blonde woman who had once been handsome and
still retained a certain portion of good looks, in spite
of her forty and more years. She lived with her
niece Olivia the child of a sister long since dead, and
with Miss Pewsey, to whom she gave a home as a
companion. But Miss Wharf well knew, that Lavinia
Pewsey was worth her weight in gold owing to the
way she praised up her good, kind, devoted, loving,
sweet, friend. The adjectives are Miss Pewsey's
own, but some people said that Sophia Wharf did
not deserve to have them attached to her. The lady
had her enemies, and these openly declared, as the
Major had done, that she was a mass of granite.
Other people, less prejudiced, urged that Miss Wharf
looked after Olivia, who was a penniless orphan. To
which the grumblers retorted that Miss Wharf liked
someone to vent her temper on, and that the poor
girl, being too pretty, did duty as a whipping boy.
This was possibly true, for Olivia and her aunt did
not get on well together. In her own way the girl
looked as cold as Miss Wharf, but this coldness was
merely a mask to hide a warm and loving nature,
while Miss Wharf was an ice-berg through and
through. However, on the whole, Sophia Wharf was
well liked, and took care to make the most of her
looks and her moderate income and her reputation
as a charitable lady. And Miss Pewsey was the
show-woman who displayed her patroness's points to
their best advantage.</p>

<p>The drawing-room of Ivy Lodge was a flimsy,
pretty, feminine, room, furnished in a gim-crack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
fashion, of the high art style. The floor was waxed,
and covered with Persian praying mats, the chairs
were gilt and had spindle legs, the settee was Empire,
the piano was encased in green wood and adorned
with much brass, the sofa was Louis Quinze and
covered with brocade, and there were many tables
of rose-wood, dainty and light, heaped high with
useless nick-knacks.</p>

<p>The walls of pale green were adorned with watercolour
pictures, and many mirrors draped with
Liberty silk. Everywhere were large bowls of
flowers, miniatures of Miss Wharf at various times
of her life, curiosities from China and Japan and the
near East, and all sorts of odds and ends which Miss
Wharf had collected on her travels. Not that she had
been to the East, for the evidences of civilisation in
those lands came from Dr. Forge and Major Tidman,
but Miss Wharf had explored Germany, Switzerland
and Italy and consequently had brought home
cuckoo-clocks, quaint carvings, pictures of the
Madonna, Etruscan idols and such like things with
which every tourist loads himself or herself. The
result was, that the drawing-room looked like a
curiosity shop, but it was considered to be one of the
prettiest drawing-rooms in Essex.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf looked too large and too substantial
for the frail furniture of the room. She had a double
chin and was certainly very stout. Very wisely she
had a special arm-chair placed in the window&mdash;from
which she could see all that was going on,&mdash;and
here she sat working most of the day. She was
great on doing fancy articles for bazaars, and silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
ties for such gentlemen as she admired, for Miss
Wharf, old maid as she was, liked male society.
The Major was her great admirer, so was young
Walker, Lady Jabe's nephew. Sophia was not very
sure of this last gentleman, as she shrewdly suspected&mdash;prompted
by Miss Pewsey&mdash;that he admired
Olivia. Rupert also admired Olivia and wanted to
marry her, a proceeding which Miss Wharf objected
to. Miss Pewsey supported her in this, for both
women were envious of the youth which had passed
from them for ever. But Miss Wharf had also
another reason, which Miss Pewsey knew, but of
which Olivia was ignorant. Hitherto Sophia had
kept it from the girl but this afternoon in a fit of
rage she let it out. The explosion did not come at
once, for Lady Jabe was in the room drinking tea,
and Miss Pewsey was flitting about, filling odd
vases with flowers. Olivia sat on the settee very
straight and very cold, looking dark and handsome,
and altogether too splendid a woman for her aunt to
tolerate.</p>

<p>"Can't you do something?" said Miss Wharf turning
her jealous eyes on the girl. "I should think
you must be tired, twiddling your thumbs all day."</p>

<p>"I'll do whatever you wish me to do," said Olivia
coldly.</p>

<p>"Then help Lavinia with the flowers."</p>

<p>Olivia rose to do so, but Miss Pewsey refused her
assistance in a shrill speech spoken as usual between
her teeth and with an emphasis on every other word.
"Oh no dear, dear, Sophia," cried Miss Pewsey, "I
have just finished, and I may say that my eye for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
colour is better than Olivia's&mdash;you don't mind my
saying so, darling," she added to the girl.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Miss Rayner who detested
the sycophant. "I never give the matter a thought."</p>

<p>"You <i>should</i> think," said Lady Jabe joining in
heavily. She was a tall masculine-looking woman
with grey hair and bushy grey eyebrows, and with
an expression of face that suggested she should have
worn a wig and sat on the bench. She dressed in
rather a manly way, and far too young for her fifty
years. On the present occasion she wore a yachting-cap,
a shirt with a stand-up, all round, collar and a
neat bow; a leather belt and a bicycling skirt of
blue serge. Her boots and shoes were of tanned
brown leather, and she carried a bamboo cane instead
of a sunshade. No one could have been more
gentlemanly. "You should think," added she once
more, "for instance you should think of marriage."</p>

<p>Miss Wharf drew herself up in her cold way. "I
fancy that Olivia, few brains as she has, is yet wise
enough not to think of marriage at twenty."</p>

<p>"It would not be much good if I did," said Olivia
calmly. "I have no money, and young men want
a rich wife."</p>

<p>"Not all," said Lady Jabe, "there's Chris&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chris is out of the question," said Miss Rayner
quickly.</p>

<p>"And pray why is he?" asked Sophia in arms at
once. She never liked Olivia to have an opinion of
her own.</p>

<p>"Because I don't love him."</p>

<p>"But Chris loves you," said Lady Jabe, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
really he's getting a very good salary in that Tea-merchant's
office. Chris, as you are aware, Olivia,
is foreign corresponding clerk to Kum-gum Li &amp; Co.
He knows Chinese," finished Lady Jabe, with tremendous
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Oh," Miss Pewsey threw up her claws, "how
delicious to be made love to in Chinese. I must
really ask Mr. Walker what is the Chinese for 'I
love you.'"</p>

<p>"Olivia prefers to hear it in English," said Miss
Wharf, spitefully.</p>

<p>"Quite so, aunt," retorted her niece, her colour
rising, "but don't you think we might change the
subject. It really isn't very interesting."</p>

<p>"But indeed I think it is," said Lady Jabe smartly,
"I come here to plead the cause of poor Chris.
His heart is breaking. Your aunt is willing to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am not," said Miss Rayner quickly, "so
please let us say no more about the matter. Mr.
Walker can marry Lotty Dean."</p>

<p>"But she's a grocer's daughter," said Lady Jabe,
who was herself the widow of an oil-merchant,
"and remember my title."</p>

<p>"Lotty isn't going to marry you, Lady Jabe."</p>

<p>"Nor Chris, if I can help it," said the other grimly.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf was just about to crush Olivia with a
particularly disagreeable remark, when the door
opened and two gentlemen entered. One was Christopher
Walker, a slim, boyish-looking young fellow,
in that callow stage of manhood which sees beauty
in every woman. The other, who followed, was
Miss Pewsey's nephew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing immature about him, although
he was but twenty eight years of age. Clarence
Burgh was tall, thin, dark and had the appearance
of a swashbuckler as he swaggered into the room.
His black eyes snapped with an unholy light and his
speech smacked too much of the Lands at the Back
of Beyond, where he had passed the most part
of his life. He was an expert rider, and daily rode
a bucking squealing, kicking stallion up and down
the road, or took long gallops into the country to
reduce the fire of the unruly beast. Burgh was
bad all through, daring, free, bold, and had a good
deal of the untamed savage about him; but he was
emphatically a man, and it was this virile atmosphere
about him, which caused his withered aunt to
adore him. And indeed Miss Wharf admired him
also, as did many of the women in Marport.
Clarence looked like a buccaneer who would carry a
woman off, and knock her down if she objected to
his love-making. Women like that sort of dominating
lord of the world, and accordingly Mr. Burgh
had nothing to complain of, so far as feminine
admiration went, during his sojourn in Marport.
But he had set his affections on Olivia, and hitherto
she had shrunk from him. All the same, brute as
he was, she admired him more than she did
effeminate Chris Walker, who smacked of the city
and of a feather-bed-four-meals-a-day existence.</p>

<p>"Oh," squeaked Miss Pewsey, flying to the
hero and clasping him round the neck, "how very,
very sweet of you to come."</p>

<p>"Hadn't anything else to do," said Clarence grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>fully,
casting himself into a chair. All his movements
were graceful like those of a panther. "How are
you Miss Wharf&mdash;Miss Rayner&mdash;Lady Jabe. I guess
you all look like a garden of spring flowers this day."</p>

<p>"But flowers we may not pluck," sighed Chris
prettily.</p>

<p>Burgh looked at him with contempt. "I reckon
a man can pick what he has a mind to," said he
drily, and then shifted his gaze to see how Olivia
took this speech. To his secret annoyance, she did
not let on she heard him.</p>

<p>"Will you have some tea, Mr. Burgh," asked
Miss Wharf.</p>

<p>"Thanks. It seems to be the sort of thing one
must drink here."</p>

<p>"You drank it in China didn't you?" asked Lady
Jabe.</p>

<p>Burgh turned quickly. "Who told you I had
been in China?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My nephew Chris. He heard you talking
Chinese to someone."</p>

<p>The dark young man looked distinctly annoyed.
"When was that?" he asked Chris.</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago," replied the other, "you were
standing at the corner of the Mansion House talking to
a Chinaman. I only caught a word or two in passing."</p>

<p>"And I guess you didn't understand," said
Clarence derisively.</p>

<p>"There you are wrong. I am in a Chinese firm,
and know the language. As a matter of fact I write
their foreign letters for them."</p>

<p>"The deuce you do," murmured Burgh looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
rather disturbed; but he said no more on the subject,
and merely enquired if the ladies were prepared for
the ball at the Bristol which was to take place in
six days. "I hear it's going to be a bully affair."</p>

<p>"Oh charming&mdash;charming," said Miss Pewsey.
"Major Tidman is one of the stewards. I asked
him for a ticket for you Clarence dear."</p>

<p>"I'll go, if Miss Rayner will dance with me."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I am going myself," said
Olivia quietly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said her aunt sharply, "of course
you are going. Everyone is going&mdash;the best ball of
the season."</p>

<p>"Even poor little me," said Miss Pewsey, with
her elderly head on one side.</p>

<p>"Huh," said the irreverent Clarence, "ain't you
past hoppin' aunt?"</p>

<p>"I can look on and admire the younger generation
dear."</p>

<p>"It will be a splendid ball," prattled Chris sipping
his tea and devouring very crumbly cake, "the
Glorious Golfers are going to spend a lot of money
in decorating the rooms. I met Mr. Ainsleigh.
He is going&mdash;a rare thing for him. He goes nowhere
as a rule."</p>

<p>Miss Wharf glanced sharply at her niece, but
beyond a faint flush, she could detect no sign of
emotion. "People who are as poor as young Ainsleigh,
can't afford to go out," she said deliberately.
"I think the wisest thing that young man could do,
would be to marry a rich girl," and she again looked
at Olivia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is certainly very handsome," said Lady Jabe
pensively, "very much like his mother. She was a
fine-looking woman, one of the Vanes of Heathersham."</p>

<p>"I remember her," said Miss Wharf, her colour
rising, "and I never thought she was good-looking
myself."</p>

<p>"Not to compare to you dear," said the sycophant.</p>

<p>But this time Miss Pewsey made a mistake. The
remark did not seem to please Miss Wharf. "I
don't care for comparisons," she said sharply, "its
bad taste to make them. I like Mr. Ainsleigh, but
I don't approve of his idling."</p>

<p>"He has never been brought up to do anything,"
said Lady Jabe.</p>

<p>"Then he ought to turn his hands to making
money in some way. That place is mortgaged and
at any time may be sold. Then he won't have a
roof over his head."</p>

<p>"I have never met Ainsleigh," said Burgh
musingly, "I guess I'd like to have a jaw along o'
him. Wasn't his father murdered in China?"</p>

<p>Miss Wharf became suddenly pale. "It is said
that he was, but I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Then he's alive," said Clarence pertinaciously,
and looking at her.</p>

<p>"No. He's dead, but he died of dysentery,
according to Dr. Forge who was with him when he
died&mdash;somewhere in the north I believe."</p>

<p>Burgh evidently stored this in his memory and
looked keenly at the woman whose bosom rose and
fell and whose colour came and went under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
steady gaze. Miss Pewsey saw that the persistent
look was annoying her patroness, and touched her
nephew's arm gently. The touch recalled Burgh to
his senses and he looked away. This time his eyes
rested on Olivia. Her colour was high and apparently
she had been listening with interest to the
conversation. "Huh," thought the swashbuckler,
"and it was about young Ainsleigh," and he stored
this in his memory also.</p>

<p>To make a sensation, which he dearly loved to do,
Chris Walker announced that he would bring a distinguished
visitor to the ball of the Glorious Golfers.
"He's a Chinaman," said he pompously, "and was
mixed up in the Boxer rebellion."</p>

<p>None of the ladies seemed impressed, as none of
them knew anything about the Boxers, or their rebellion.
But Burgh looked up. "Who is he anyhow?"
he demanded, compressing his lips.</p>

<p>"A Chinese gentleman called Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"What a very extraordinary name," said Miss
Pewsey, and suddenly began to take a deep interest
in matters Chinese. While she chatted with Chris
who was willing to afford her all information,
Burgh folded his arms and leaned back apparently
thinking deeply. His face was not pleasant to behold.
Olivia saw the evil look and shivered. Then
she rose and was about to steal from the room,
when her aunt called to her sharply. "Don't go
Olivia I want to speak with you."</p>

<p>"And I want to take my usual walk," said Lady
Jabe rising and settling her collar, "Chris?"</p>

<p>A tap on the shoulder brought the slim young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to his feet, and giving his arm to his masculine aunt
the two departed. Burgh rose also. "I guess I'll
make tracks also?" he said smartly. "Walker,
you and I can have a yarn together, later."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey followed her nephew to the door.
"Do you wish to ask young Mr. Walker more about
Tung-yu?" she asked.</p>

<p>Clarence wheeled round quickly. "What do you
know of him aunt?"</p>

<p>"It's such a strange name," simpered Miss
Pewsey, looking very innocent, "and I am interested
in China. You were out there a long time Clarence."</p>

<p>"Amongst other places, yes. I hung round a bit."</p>

<p>"Then you must tell me all about the natives,"
said Miss Pewsey, "I want to know of their robes
and their fans and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fans," said Burgh starting: but Miss Pewsey
with an <ins title="artficial">artificial</ins> laugh flitted back into the room,
leaving him uneasy and non-plussed. He walked
away frowning darkly.</p>

<p>Olivia would have walked away also frowning, as
she was indignant at the way in which her aunt had
spoken of Rupert. But Miss Wharf gave her no
chance of leaving the room or the house. Olivia had
never seen her aunt so pale or upset. She looked
as white as chalk, and controlled her emotion with
difficulty. Lavinia Pewsey glanced at the two,
guessed there was about to be a row, and glided
away. She always kept out of trouble.</p>

<p>"Now," said Miss Wharf when they were alone,
"I want an explanation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Rupert's Secret</span></h4>


<p>Olivia was astonished to see the emotion of her
aunt, for, as a rule Miss Wharf was cold and self-contained.
The two had never got on well together,
and the elder woman was undeniably jealous of the
youth and superior good looks of the younger. But
as Olivia owed bed and board to her aunt, she
always behaved as well as possible to one who was
very trying in many ways. It is only just to say, that
Miss Pewsey made matters much worse by tale-bearing,
and probably had she been out of the house,
Miss Wharf and her niece might have got on better.
But they could never have been congenial companions.
The difference between their natures was too great.</p>

<p>"Yes" said Miss Wharf throwing herself back in
her seat, and feeling irritated by the silence of
Olivia. "I want an explanation."</p>

<p>"What about?" asked the girl seating herself
opposite and folding her hands, which, Miss Wharf
noticed with bitterness, were more slender and
delicate <ins title="that">than</ins> her own.</p>

<p>"You know well enough."</p>

<p>"If it's about Rupert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There," snapped the aunt, "I knew you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
guess. Yes it is about young Ainsleigh, and how
dare you call him Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Because I love him," said Olivia firmly, and
looked directly into the cold blue eyes of her aunt.</p>

<p>"Then you must put this love out of your head.
You shall never marry him&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"If I choose, and I do choose," said Olivia calmly,
but with a fine colour. "I shall certainly marry
him. I am of age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a pauper."</p>

<p>"Rupert would not marry me for my money."</p>

<p>"He is wise; for you have none."</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to speak to me in this way,"
said Olivia, "to remind me of obligations. I am
aware that my parents died poor and left me a
penniless orphan. I am aware that you took me in
and educated me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And acted like a mother to you," said Miss
Wharf vehemently.</p>

<p>"No. You never acted like a mother. With
you, I have had a most unhappy life."</p>

<p>"Olivia," the elder woman started furiously from
her chair, "how dare you say that. Have I grudged
you clothes or food. Did I not send you to a first-class
school and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So far as material things are concerned you
have done everything Aunt Sophia, and I thank
you for what you have done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A fine way you have of showing it," scoffed Miss
Wharf.</p>

<p>"But a mother you have never been," went on
Olivia calmly, "you have never given me a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
word; you speak to me before visitors as you should
not do: you make me slave for you and run messages
and talk of me to others as though I were a servant.
What love have you ever shown me?" demanded
Olivia, starting up in her turn, and also becoming
excited. "I long for love. My heart yearns for it.
I would like to be a daughter to you, but always you
have kept me at arm's length. Aunt Sophia let me
go. I can earn my bread as a governess, or as a
typist. It will be better for us both."</p>

<p>"No," said Aunt Sophia, looking as hard as
stone.</p>

<p>"I shall not let you go. If you have any gratitude
in you, you will remain and help me to manage the
house."</p>

<p>"You have Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>"She is not a relative, you are."</p>

<p>"And so you treat me worse than you do her.
Well, Aunt Sophia, I am not ungrateful though you
seem to think I am. I shall stop with you. I
only ask for a little more consideration."</p>

<p>"I give you every consideration. As for love, I
cannot give it to you or to anyone. I gave all the
love my nature was capable of feeling to Markham
Ainsleigh, and he rejected my love. Yes, you may
look astonished, but it was this man's father who
broke my heart."</p>

<p>"And that is why you don't want Rupert to
marry me."</p>

<p>"That is the reason," said Miss Wharf sitting
down and growing more her calm stony self. "I was
almost engaged to Markham Ainsleigh: but he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Violet Vane and fell in love with her. He left me and
made her his wife. Can you wonder that I hate the
son of the woman who stole my love away from me?"</p>

<p>"Rupert is the son of the man you loved&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And of the man who cheated me. Look at my
lonely life, at my starved heart. I hate the Ainsleighs&mdash;there's
only one left but I hate him. And
when I heard Markham was murdered in China I
was glad&mdash;yes, very glad."</p>

<p>"What an unforgiving nature you have."</p>

<p>"I have every right to be unforgiving. Markham
ruined my life. And do you think I'll let you marry
Rupert&mdash;the son of that woman. No! Marry him,
and I leave what money I have to Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>"You can if you like, Aunt Sophia. I don't want
your money."</p>

<p>"Reflect," said Miss Wharf violently. "I have a
thousand a year. Half of that goes to a distant
relative, and the remainder you shall have if you
will give this man up. Five hundred a year is not
to be thrown away."</p>

<p>"I cannot give Rupert up," said Olivia firmly.</p>

<p>"Think girl," pleaded Miss Wharf, her face becoming
red and wrinkled with the violence of her
passion, "there are other men who love you.
Young Walker would make you a good husband,
and Lady Jabe is most anxious for the match."</p>

<p>"I like Chris," said Olivia, "and I have known
him all my life. But I can't marry him. I want a
master when I marry."</p>

<p>"Then take Clarence Burgh," said Miss Wharf,
"he will be your master."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. He's a brute."</p>

<p>"He's a man&mdash;much more of a man than Rupert
Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"I deny that" said Olivia fiercely.</p>

<p>"He is. Clarence has been all over the world.
He has fought everywhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So has Major Tidman. Do you advise me to
marry him?"</p>

<p>"He would make you a better husband than
Rupert, old as he is. That young Ainsleigh is a
dreamer. He is on the point of losing his estates,
yet he sits at Royabay doing nothing."</p>

<p>"He intends to do something, and save the estates."</p>

<p>"Never. He is not the sort of man to work.
Olivia if you will take Chris Walker, or Clarence
Burgh for your husband I shall leave you five
hundred a year. If you refuse I give you nothing."</p>

<p>"I prefer nothing&mdash;and Rupert."</p>

<p>"Then you shall not have him. I'll ruin him first."</p>

<p>Olivia started. "You can't ruin him. You talk
wildly."</p>

<p>"Oh do I," sneered Miss Wharf, "that shows you
know little of me or of my business. Listen. I bought
up a mortgage on the Royabay estate. It cost me
money which I could ill afford to pay away. But
I bought it so as to ruin the son of that woman Vane
who took Markham from me. I always intended to
buy the estate, or at least to drive Rupert from the
place, but if you will give him up, I shall forego my
revenge. Now what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," faltered Olivia, who had turned very
pale. "I don't know what to say."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you give the man up."</p>

<p>"I won't see him, if that will please you."</p>

<p>"No. It doesn't please me. You must give him
up, and engage yourself to Mr. Walker or to Mr.
Burgh."</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot&mdash;" said poor Olivia.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf stamped her foot and bit her lip.
"You are as obstinate as your mother was before
you," she said savagely. "I shall give you one
month to make up your mind, and that is very
generous of me. If you surrender Rupert and choose
one of the other two, I will not <ins title="forclose">foreclose</ins> the mortgage
and will leave you five hundred a year."</p>

<p>"When can you foreclose?" asked Olivia
anxiously.</p>

<p>"By the end of the year. So it rests with you, if
Rupert Ainsleigh leaves his home in six months or
keeps it. Now you can go."</p>

<p>Olivia Rayner was not a girl who would stand
dictation. But for some reason or another she
meekly bowed her head and went out, leaving Miss
Wharf to calm down over her needle-work.</p>

<p>The girl went to her own room, and lay down to
think over the situation. What she thought or
what plan she conceived, it is difficult to say; but
she came down to dinner quite composed. Her
aunt looked at her sharply, and Miss Pewsey with
suspicion, but neither of them made any remark
bearing on the storm. On the contrary Miss
Wharf chatted about the ball and talked of her dress
and even advised Olivia about her costume. "You
will look very well in white," said Miss Wharf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"But not so lovely as my Sophia in pale blue,"
said Miss Pewsey with her usual emphasis. "I
know you will be the belle of the ball darling Sophia."</p>

<p>"I have been the belle of several balls in my
time," said Miss Wharf good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"And will be still," purred Miss Pewsey like the
cat she was, "my dear nephew said you were a
rattling fine woman."</p>

<p>"It sounds like one of Mr. Burgh's speeches,"
said Olivia with great contempt. She knew that the
buccaneer loved her, and therefore disliked him the
more.</p>

<p>"Oh Olivia how can you," cried the little old
maid, throwing up her hands, "when poor, dear,
darling, Clarence worships the ground you walk on.
He's got money too, and wants a wife!"</p>

<p>"Let him marry Lotty Dean then."</p>

<p>"That retired grocer's daughter," cried Miss
Pewsey, drawing herself up, "no indeed. I may be
poor, but I am of gentle blood Olivia. The Pewsey's
have been in Essex for generations. My papa was
rich and could afford to send me to a fashionable
school when I met my own Sophia. But poor
sweet papa lost his money and then&mdash;oh, dear me."
Miss Pewsey squeezed out a tear. "What sad
times I have had."</p>

<p>"You're all right now, Lavinia," said Miss Wharf
stolidly, eating fruit and sipping port wine.</p>

<p>"Yes dearest Sophia, thanks to your large and
generous heart. I have no one in the world but
you and Clarence. He is the son of my only sister,
and has travelled&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"In China," said Olivia.</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey narrowed her eyes and looked as
though about to scratch.</p>

<p>"In China, of course. But why do you make
that remark, Olivia?"</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. "I observed
that Mr. Burgh has not very pleasant recollections
of China," she said deliberately, "he was not pleased
to find that Mr. Walker could talk the language,
and he was uncomfortable when the name Tung-yu
was mentioned."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey bit her lip. "Do you know anything
of Tung-yu?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should I. All I know, is that Chris
Walker says he will bring the man down here for
the ball."</p>

<p>The little old maid looked hard at the girl, but
Olivia bore her scrutiny composedly. She wondered
why Miss Pewsey stared so hard, and laid such
emphasis on the Chinese name, but the matter
slipped from her mind when she retired to her room.
She would have wondered still more had she known
that Miss Pewsey came up the stairs and listened at
the door of the bed-room.</p>

<p>Olivia had arranged to meet Rupert near the
band-stand, as their meetings were secret because of
Miss Wharf's dislike. Certainly the young man
had come to the house, and Miss Wharf had received
him with cold dignity: but when he showed a
marked preference for Olivia's company, she gave
him to understand that she did not approve. Henceforth
Rupert stopped away from Ivy Lodge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
met Olivia at intervals near the band-stand. So
Olivia, putting on a dark dress and a veil, slipped
out of the house, and took her way along the brilliantly
lighted front. She had often gone before
and always had left her aunt and Miss Pewsey sitting
in the drawing-room, Miss Wharf working and the
companion reading the newspaper. Miss Wharf
never by any chance looked at a newspaper herself,
but left it to Miss Pewsey to cull the choice news
for her delectation.</p>

<p>So Olivia, feeling quite safe, stepped lightly along
to where the crowd gathered round the stand. It
was a perfect night and very warm, therefore many
people were seated in the chairs and strolling across
the grass. Olivia went to a certain corner, and, as she
expected, found her lover. He was not in evening-dress,
but for the sake of the meeting had assumed
a dark serge suit. As she advanced, he recognised
her and came forward taking off his hat. Then he
gave her his arm and the two strolled to the far end
of the green where they sat down under the fence
which was round the flag-staff. There, removed
from everyone, they could talk in moderately loud
tones.</p>

<p>"My darling," said Rupert, possessing himself of
Olivia's hand. "I thought you would not come.
You were late."</p>

<p>"I could not get away before. Miss Pewsey
watches me like a cat does a mouse, and with the
same disposition to pounce, I expect."</p>

<p>"She's a detestable woman," said Rupert angrily,
"why can't she leave you alone?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. Rupert, she wants me to marry
her nephew."</p>

<p>"What, that bounder who rides so furiously,"
cried Rupert fiercely, "you don't mean to say that
he dares&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not in words, but he looks&mdash;oh," Olivia shivered,
"you know the sort of look a man like that, gives
you."</p>

<p>"I'll twist his neck if he insults you."</p>

<p>"Then Miss Pewsey would complain to my aunt
and I should get into trouble. Oh, Rupert," she
said softly, "I am so afraid."</p>

<p>"Of that man. Nonsense."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;of everything. I can keep Mr. Burgh off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Rupert jealously.</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey's nephew. I can manage him,
bold as he is. But it is you I am afraid of. Listen,"
and Olivia told the young man what she had learned
from Miss Wharf that afternoon. "She can ruin
you," said the poor girl, almost crying, "and she
will if she learns the truth."</p>

<p>Rupert pressed the hand he held. "Why not
tell her the truth," he said. "I'm willing to face
poverty if you are."</p>

<p>"Rupert, are you mad? If Aunt Sophia learned
that we were married&mdash;hark, what was that?" and
Olivia rose, and nervously peered into the shadows,
"I thought I heard a noise."</p>

<p>"It's nothing. Only some rats in the long grass
within the fence. No one's about. They're all over
at the band. But about our marriage, Olivia. Miss
Wharf must learn sooner or later."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. But you know I asked you to keep it
quiet that I might not have trouble with her. It
was selfish of me, for it would have been braver of
me to have faced her anger and then have told all
the world that we were married at that Registry
Office. But I'm glad now I didn't. She would
have ruined you."</p>

<p>"She can't do anything till the end of the year."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell me she held this
mortgage?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought that before the end of the year
I might manage to pay it and the other mortgages
off. Then we could announce that we were married,
and live at Royabay on what small income I have."</p>

<p>"I don't mind about the income," said Mrs.
Ainsleigh, for that Olivia secretly was. "I'd live
on a shilling a day with you, darling. But aunt
threatens if I marry you to cut me out of her will.
She would do so at once if she knew the truth, and
leave the money to Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>"Let her. I daresay that old maid has schemed
for it. She's a wicked old woman that and worthy
of her bounder of a nephew. Never mind about the
money or the mortgage. Let us announce the
marriage. I don't like the position you occupy. It is
not fit that my wife should be exposed to the
attentions of a cad like this Burgh."</p>

<p>"Wait till the end of the year," said Olivia
feverishly, "then you may be able to get money, to
put things straight. It is best to keep the matter
quiet now. Oh how I wish we had money Rupert."</p>

<p>"I may be able to make it out of the fan?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"What fan?" asked Olivia looking at him.</p>

<p>Rupert laughed. "I forgot you don't know."
He took the slip of paper from his pocket-book and
lighting a match he read the description of the fan.
"I went up to the place," he continued dropping the
lucifer, "and saw a Chinaman, Tung-yu&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What," said Olivia starting, "why that is the
man Mr. Walker is going to bring to the ball. He's
a clerk in the firm of Kum-gum-Li and Company."</p>

<p>"That's strange. I thought he was the keeper of
the Joss house in Perry Street, Whitechapel.
Humph! Does Walker know of the fan?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But he knows this Tung-yu, and
I think, so does Mr. Burgh. He seemed much
annoyed when he heard the name."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. And Rupert. Mr. Burgh speaks
Chinese&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He must be very clever then for I hear it is a
most awful language to get hold of. Was Burgh
ever in China?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He brought the fan from that place?"</p>

<p>"Fan." Rupert turned round sharply, "what
fan?"</p>

<p>"The one you talk about," said Olivia innocently.</p>

<p>"I recognised it at once from the description you
read just now."</p>

<p>"Are you sure," said Rupert much excited, for
he never expected to hear of the missing fan from
Olivia of all people.</p>

<p>"Quite sure&mdash;positive. The fan is painted green
on one side and the sticks on the other are overlaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
with thin jade, so I suppose it gets its name from
the mineral. Then it has a cord of yellow silk with
four beads and half a bead, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the same. Where did Burgh get it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He says he brought it from
China, and offered it to me. I refused it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Ainsleigh fuming,
"well?"</p>

<p>"Then he gave it to my aunt."</p>

<p>"And has Miss Wharf got it now?"</p>

<p>"I think so, but I have not seen it lately. I expect
if she has, she will use it at the ball."</p>

<p>"And Tung-yu who advertises, is coming to the
ball," mused Rupert, "there doesn't seem much
chance for me. I expect your aunt will make the
money after all."</p>

<p>"It won't be much. Who would give a large
sum for that fan?"</p>

<p>"Tung-yu will. He is ready to give five thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Olivia with real regret, "and I refused
it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did," cried Rupert angrily, "I
would rather everything went than that you should
accept presents from that bounder. Well I fear my
chance is gone Olivia. I'm ruined."</p>

<p>"Dearest I will face the ruin with you," and in
the shadows they kissed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Concerning the Fan</span></h4>


<p>Rupert returned to Royabay in rather a melancholy
frame of mind. He found himself in a very
difficult situation, and there did not seem to be any
chance of his extricating himself therefrom, now
that Miss Wharf possessed the fan. It was strange
that she should have received it from Clarence
Burgh, and Rupert wondered how that dashing
young gentleman became its owner. However,
there was little use speculating on this. Miss
Wharf had the fan, and probably she would keep it,
unless the large sum of money offered by Tung-yu
tempted her to do business. Ainsleigh wondered
also, if the old maid had read the papers, and if she
had seen the advertisement.</p>

<p>"But what does it matter to me," said Rupert,
as he turned up the avenue. "I won't get the
money, and Miss Wharf will see me hanged first
before she will let me make such a sum. While I
am poor, she holds me in her clutches, and thinks
by means of that mortgage to prevent my marriage
with Olivia. What would she say if she knew that
we were already married. I was wrong to consent
to keep the affair secret, even though Olivia wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
it. In any case Miss Wharf can do nothing, till the
end of the year, and the truth is bound to come
to her ears sooner or later. Then she will strike
and spare not. I believe that's the motto of the
Wharfs, and it fits her spiteful temper excellently."</p>

<p>Then Rupert went on to reflect on what Olivia
had told him of Aunt Sophia's romance with Markham
Ainsleigh. The young man had never heard
of it before, as he knew little of his father, who had
gone to China, a few years after his heir was born.
In fact Markham only waited till there was a male
Ainsleigh to carry on the succession and to inherit
what remained of the estates, and then steamed to
the Far East to seek fortune. But fortune had
proved unkind and the poor man had died&mdash;- whether
of dysentery or by violence, it is difficult to say.
Some people said one thing and some another, but
even Rupert did not know the truth. Dr. Forge,
who had worked the mine in the Kan-su province
along with Markham, knew the absolute truth, and
he ascribed the death to dysentery, so Rupert, for
the time being at all events, was willing to accept
this explanation. He had no reason to doubt the
loyalty of Theophilus Forge who had been a college
chum of his father's.</p>

<p>Thinking in this way and considering whether it
would not be advisable to proclaim his marriage so
as to release his wife from the odious attentions of
Clarence Burgh, the young man arrived at the house.
He was met in the hall by Mrs Petley, who <ins title="annouced">announced</ins>
that Major Tidman was waiting to see her young
master. Rupert nodded in an absent-minded way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and was going to the library where the Major was
kicking his heels, when Mrs Petley caught him by
the arm. "It's walking again," said Mrs Petley,
whose fat face was pale, "and say what you like
Master Rupert, trouble is coming."</p>

<p>She was a stout old dame with a red face suggestive
of drink, a most unfair thing to be said of her as
she drank nothing stronger than gin and water, one
tumbler a night before retiring. But Mrs Petley
had been a cook in her early days; later on she
assumed the position of Rupert's nurse, and finally,
having married Petley the butler, she became housekeeper
of Royabay. She was a common vulgar old
woman, but loyal to the core, and adored Rupert.
When he had to dismiss the greater part of his servants
he retained John Petley, and John Petley's wife,
who continued to serve him faithfully and always
hoped for better days. Mrs Petley, being intensely
superstitious, was always influenced by the appearance
of Abbot Raoul whose walking was supposed to
predict bad luck to the Ainsleighs. If the ghost did
not appear Mrs Petley was happy, but when it did
she always prognosticated evil. And it must be
admitted that Rupert usually had more trouble with
his creditors when Abbot Raoul <i>did</i> visit his old
haunts. He seemed to be a most malignant spirit.
But Rupert as an educated man, was not going to
admit occult influence.</p>

<p>"Nonsense Mrs. Petley," said he, shaking her
off, "so far as trouble is concerned, Abbot Raoul
might remain visible for ever. Am I ever out of
trouble?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that you ain't, worse luck. But this walking
means something extra special as I said to
John."</p>

<p>"Where did you see the old beast, I mean Abbot
Raoul of course."</p>

<p>Mrs. Petley started. "Hush deary," she whispered
looking round in a fearful manner, "don't speak
evil of speerits. It may be round, and you might
anger it. I saw it in the cloisters."</p>

<p>"Near the place?" asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"Aye, standing on the black square where its
mortal body was burnt poor soul. It was <ins title="pinting">pointing</ins>
to a tree."</p>

<p>"To what tree&mdash;there are plenty in the cloisters."</p>

<p>"To the copper beech, as you might say Master
Rupert. And angry enough he looked. I nearly
fainted."</p>

<p>"You should be used to the ghost by this time
Mrs. Petley."</p>

<p>"Ghosts is things custom won't help you with,"
said Mrs. Petley mysteriously, "they freeze your
blood every time. Just as I was thinking of a good
scream and a faint, it vanished."</p>

<p>"Into thin air like the witches in Macbeth," said
Rupert lightly. "Well it doesn't need Abbot Raoul
to come and tell me trouble is near. I'm likely to
have a good deal by the end of the year."</p>

<p>"Oh Master Rupert what is it?" gasped the old
woman.</p>

<p>"Nothing I can tell you at present," said
Ainsleigh carelessly, "I have a good mind to seek
Abbot Raoul myself and see if he can't help me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
but I'm not psychic as you are Mrs. Petley. I see
nothing."</p>

<p>"And a good thing too," said the ex-cook solemnly,
"if it spoke to you it would be to make matters
worse, though worse they can't be."</p>

<p>"Oh yes they can," said Rupert grimly. "I may
have to leave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never," cried Mrs. Petley smiting her fat hands
together. "Royabay can never do without an
Ainsleigh within its walls."</p>

<p>"It will have to content itself with Abbot Raoul,
and I hope he'll jolly well frighten the creditors."</p>

<p>"Drat them," said Mrs. Petley vigorously, "but
Master Rupert why did it pint to the copper beech."</p>

<p>"I can't say. Ask it when next you see it. But
I must go to Major Tidman. He'll be angry if I
keep him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Petley tossed her head and snorted. "The
idear of old Farmer Tidman's son, being angry with
the likes of you Master Rupert. I mind him when
he was a brat of a lad and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but I must go," said Ainsleigh rather
impatiently and left Mrs. Petley talking to the air.</p>

<p>Major Tidman, whose ears must have burnt at
the thoughts which occupied Mrs. Petley's brain,
was seated in the most comfortable arm-chair he
could find, and smoked a good cigar. He had a
bottle of port and a glass before him, and apparently
had made himself at home while waiting.</p>

<p>"Hope you don't mind my making free with the
wine-list," said Tidman, who looked rather uneasy,
as he rose. "I've waited two hours."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"What about?" said Rupert, throwing his cap
down and sinking wearily into a near chair, "anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I am," said the Major, "all wrong my dear boy.
You see in me a beast and a false friend."</p>

<p>"Indeed. How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"I have been concealing things from you," said
the Major ruefully, "and all to make money. I'm
really getting avaricious, Ainsleigh," added the
Major desperately, "and it's spoiling my character."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rupert filling his pipe, and wondering
what this out-burst meant, "Byron says that
avarice is a fine old gentlemanly vice. If you have
only that fault to blame yourself for, you are very
lucky."</p>

<p>"But I should have told you about the fan."</p>

<p>Rupert blew out the match he had just lighted
and sat up. "What's that about the fan?" he
asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I know something about it," said Tidman
fortifying his courage with a glass of wine, "and I
should have spoken the other evening after dinner
when you read that advertisement. But I thought
I'd get the fan myself and secure the five thousand
pounds&mdash;though to be sure I didn't know what that
Tung-yu would pay for it at the time."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert drily, "I told you that later.
Well, Major, you haven't treated me quite on the
square, but I forgive you. I expect neither of us
will make money out of that fan."</p>

<p>"No," said Tidman still more ruefully. "Forge
has lost it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert looked puzzled. "Forge? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is part of my confession of trickery," said
the Major rubbing his bald head. "You see Ainsleigh,
I held my tongue when you read out about the fan,
but I knew where it was all the time."</p>

<p>"And where was it?" asked the young man staring.</p>

<p>"Forge has it&mdash;or rather Forge had it," said the
Major, and he related his interview with the doctor
when Rupert had departed. "So you see," added
the Major sadly "I'm punished for my wrong-doing.
I'm very sorry, as I like you, Ainsleigh, and after all
I'd be glad to see you make the money, though
I'm not so well off myself as people think, and five
thousand pounds would help me a lot. However,
I hope you will think I have made amends for
my momentary lapse from squareness by thus
confessing."</p>

<p>"Oh that's all right Tidman. But treat me openly
for the future. How did you know that Forge had
had the fan?"</p>

<p>Rupert did not tell what he had heard from Olivia
for the moment. He first wished to hear all that the
Major had to say. Tidman had certainly acted
wrongly, as he should not have taken advantage of
Rupert's confidence, but now he apparently wished
to behave properly and Ainsleigh put the Major's
temporary deceit out of his mind.</p>

<p>"I gave Forge the fan," blurted out the Major.</p>

<p>"The deuce you did," said Ainsleigh looking
puzzled. "And where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"In Canton seven years ago," confessed Tidman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"I was travelling there for my health, and I had
an adventure."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>But Tidman did not seem inclined to speak out.
"I'll tell you on another occasion," he said with a
shudder, "it was not a very pleasant adventure, and
Forge, who was in Canton at the time, got me out of
it. I stuck to the fan though."</p>

<p>"Oh, so the fan was the cause of the adventure?"</p>

<p>"Partly" admitted Tidman reluctantly. "I'll
tell you later as I say," he wiped his forehead, "I
can't tell you now, it's too awful. I got the fan
though and Forge took a fancy to it. He asked me
for it in Canton and I refused. He asked again in
England and I gave it to him. He's had it all these
seven years, locked up in that black japan cabinet
with the gold figures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. Its in that Chinese room of his.
Well?"</p>

<p>"After you went away the other day I asked him
to give me the fan back, as I wanted to get the
money from Tung-yu. Forge refused, as he said the
fan has something to do with a secret&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whose secret?"</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong's secret. He is the real owner of the
fan you know. Forge seems to hate Lo-Keong,
and said the fan would get him into trouble."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;how?" asked Ainsleigh impatiently.</p>

<p>The Major wiped his face again, "I don't know&mdash;I
can't say. But Forge said there was a secret connected
with the fan&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"You said that before," cried Rupert becoming
exasperated.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I am saying, and that's the
truth," stammered Tidman becoming hotter and
redder, "but Forge said if I found the secret he would
give me the fan. He then opened the cabinet and
found that the fan was gone."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He turned as white as a sheet, and said that his
life was at stake."</p>

<p>Rupert rose to pace the room. The mystery of
the fan piqued him, "I wonder what he meant by
that?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>"Something horrid if it has to do with the
Chinese," said the Major, "you have no idea what
brutes they are. But Forge thought that Mrs.
Bressy, the old woman who looks after him, might
have sneaked the fan, as she is fond of taking things
and pawning them. But she swore she had never
set eyes on it."</p>

<p>"Wasn't the cabinet locked?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's the strange part, and Forge has
the key on his watch-chain. The lock wasn't
broken, and no other key would fit it, so how it
was opened, is a mystery. But the fan's gone."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Rupert, facing the Major sharply,
"and Miss Wharf has the very fan you speak of."</p>

<p>Tidman fell back in his chair and gasped till he
was purple in the face. "Wh&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;t," he drawled
out. "Sophia Wharf?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Olivia told me, when I explained how I
wished to find the fan and make money. It seems
that young Burgh&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"A detestable young cad," snapped Tidman.</p>

<p>"I agree with you. He dares to admire my&mdash;to
admire Olivia," said Rupert nearly letting his
secret slip out, "and, to gain her good graces, he
offered her this fan. She refused, and he then
presented it to Miss Wharf, who took it and who
has it now."</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned the Major, "and it's worth five
thousand. What luck some people have."</p>

<p>Rupert shrugged his shoulders. "The luck will
not come our way," he replied carelessly, "and to
tell you the truth I don't much care. I expect
Miss Wharf will sell the fan to Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"But she doesn't know about his wishing to buy
it?"</p>

<p>"She may have seen the advertisement, and you
know Tung-yu is coming to the ball at the
Bristol."</p>

<p>Major Tidman rose like a jack-in-the-box. "Who
says so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Young Walker. Tung-yu is not the keeper of
the Whitechapel Joss-house as I thought. He is a
clerk in the firm of Kum-gum-Li."</p>

<p>"Chris Walker also works for them," interpolated
the Major.</p>

<p>"Certainly, and he is bringing Tung-yu to the
ball. I don't know why, and I don't much care,"
added Ainsleigh somewhat crossly. "I am about
tired of this fan business. What will you do?"</p>

<p>Major Tidman buttoned his coat. "I'm going
straight to Forge," he said, "and I shall tell him that
young Burgh had the fan. I know how he got it."</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed," said Rupert yawning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Miss Pewsey stole it from the cabinet."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Why should she do that?"</p>

<p>"Because she's always about Forge's house. He
told me that he might marry her&mdash;ugh," the Major
sneered, "fancy marrying that old cat."</p>

<p>"Different people have different tastes," said
Ainsleigh coolly, "but if Forge is going to marry
Miss Pewsey all the more reason she should not
steal the fan."</p>

<p>"But she did," insisted the Major. "I'm sure
she stole it and gave it to that scamp of a nephew
so that he might gain Miss Rayner's goodwill. You
see, Miss Pewsey would like to see Burgh married
to Olivia, as she&mdash;Miss Pewsey I mean&mdash;could then
finger the five hundred a year Miss Wharf will leave
her niece."</p>

<p>"He had better be certain that Olivia will inherit
the money first," said Rupert grimly, thinking of
the secret marriage, "and Miss Pewsey hates
Olivia."</p>

<p>"She hates everyone," said Tidman shrugging his
plump shoulders, "but she hasn't a penny to bless
herself with, and when Miss Wharf dies she will be
cast on the world. Even five hundred a year is a
consideration to her, and if her nephew can secure
that by marrying Olivia, why, all the better for Miss
Pewsey."</p>

<p>But Rupert shook his head. "If Miss Pewsey
had that scheme in her head, she would be more
friendly with Olivia," he said, "and she can set her
mind at rest: Burgh will not marry Olivia."</p>

<p>"He's a dangerous rival Ainsleigh."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pooh. I can manage that young man and half
a dozen like him. You don't think I'd give up the
girl I love, to anyone, Tidman."</p>

<p>"No," said the Major, looking at the frank brave
face of his host, "but Burgh is unscrupulous, and
will make mischief. However, perhaps Forge will
deal with him for this fan business. When Forge
learns that Miss Pewsey has stolen his fan, he won't
marry her. I'll have the satisfaction of spoiling her
plans at all events."</p>

<p>"She seems to have a great many plans according
to you," yawned Ainsleigh, "but frankly I think
you have found a mare's nest. I don't believe anything
will come of the matter. It's moonshine."</p>

<p>Tidman marched to the door. "We'll see," said
he determinedly. "I believe trouble is coming to
you through young Burgh," and he departed.</p>

<p>Rupert left alone lighted his pipe and thought of
Mrs. Petley's fancy concerning the ghost. "If this
is the trouble," said he to himself. "I don't mind.
Burgh won't get Olivia unless over my dead body.
As to this fan&mdash;pah!"</p>

<p>But he little knew what disasters the fan would
bring to him. Abbot Raoul's ghost was not walking
for nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Burgh's Story</span></h4>


<p>Next morning Major Tidman was seated in his
well-furnished room in the Bristol Hotel. From
the window he commanded a fine view of the mouth
of the Thames, of the pier, and of the picturesque
lower town. But the view did not gain the attention
of the Major, worthy as it was of his notice.
He seated himself at the table which was spread for
breakfast, and proceeded to make a good meal.
Perhaps he did not eat so well as usual for the
Major was worried, as was evident from the cross
expression of his face. On the previous night he
had gone to see Forge, and had told him how Miss
Wharf became possessed of the fan. The doctor
had listened to him quietly, but had refrained from
making any observation, even when Tidman reminded
him of his remark, as to his life being at
stake. The interview had on the whole been unsatisfactory,
and Tidman was not at all pleased.
He wished to learn the truth about the fan.</p>

<p>"There's some secret connected with it," muttered
the Major, while he devoured buttered eggs rapidly,
"and that secret means a lot of money. Five
thousand pounds is worth having. I could buy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
plot of waste land near the church and build an
hotel there. I believe it would pay. Then there's
Forge's life, which, as he says, hangs on the fan,
though in what way I can't find out. If I got the
fan, I might be able to get something out of him.
I would make Forge and Tung-yu bid against one
another, and perhaps I'd get even more than is
offered. Ainsleigh can't say anything against me
now, as I am acting quite square and above board.
He's got no enterprise," thought the little man
with some scorn, "or he'd get Olivia to take the fan
from her aunt and make the money out of it. But
if he won't, I will, so I'll see Miss Wharf to-day and
try what I can do. I daresay I'd get it from her for
a five pound note&mdash;that is if she hasn't seen the
advertisement. She's keen after money, too&mdash;as
keen as I am. Humph," added Tidman, filling
himself a second cup of coffee. "I wonder why
Tung-yu was such a fool as to tell Ainsleigh he was
willing to give five thousand. Anyone, not knowing
the value of the fan, would get it cheap. There's a
mystery about it, and the mystery means money.
I must get to the bottom of the affair. Forge is no
good, as he is holding his tongue: even when I told
him that Miss Pewsey stole it, he did not seem to
mind. But he'll never marry her after this, so I've
spoilt her chance of marriage, the cat. Though
why Forge should marry an old fiend who is eighty,
if she's an hour, I can't make out. But Forge was
always secretive," ended the Major in disgust, and
reached for the <i>paté-de-foi-gras</i>.</p>

<p>His meal was interrupted by a smart young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
waiter, who intimated that a lady and gentleman
wished to see the Major. Tidman was rather surprised
at a call being paid at ten o'clock in the
morning: but he was still more surprised, when at
the heels of the waiter appeared Miss Pewsey and
Dr. Forge. The latter looked much his usual self,
hungry, dismal, and like a bird of prey: but Miss
Pewsey had a colour in her cheeks and a fire in
her black eyes, which made her look younger. It
seemed that her errand was not a peaceful one.</p>

<p>"To what am I indebted&mdash;?" began the courtly
Major, when the little old maid cut him short with
vinegary politeness.</p>

<p>"Indebted," she said, standing very straight and
stiff, and quite ignoring the chair placed for her.
"Oh, indeed,&mdash;how very polite we are. Judas!"
she snapped out the word with flaming eyes. "Oh,
Judas!"</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Pewsey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd like to see me in the dock would you?"
cried Miss Pewsey tossing her head and trembling
with wrath, "I'm a thief am I&mdash;oh you military fat
Judas."</p>

<p>"Did you come here to insult me?" asked
Tidman growing purple.</p>

<p>"If you put it in that way I did," sniffed the lady,
"and also to ask plainly, what you meant by stating
to my promised husband here, that I stole a fan
from his cabinet?"</p>

<p>Tidman changed from purple to scarlet. He had
not reckoned on the doctor speaking to Miss Pewsey,
and he turned a look of reproach on his friend. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
doctor immediately took up the challenge, "I see
you think I have been too free with my tongue,"
said he deliberately, "it is not my custom as you
know. But I told you Major that I was engaged to
Miss Pewsey, and I thought it only right that she
should know the aspersions you have cast on her
character."</p>

<p>"A character," cried the lady, "which has stood
the test of years and which stands deservedly high.
I am a Pewsey of Essex," she added as though the
whole county belonged to her, "and never before
have I been accused of thieving&mdash;Judas," she shot
out the name again, and the Major quailed. He
saw that he was in the wrong, owing to Forge's
betrayal, and had to make the best of it.</p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry," he said apologetically,
"quite a mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. A jury will give their opinion on
that," sniffed the maiden.</p>

<p>"No! No I beg of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The damages will be laid at five thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"The price of the fan," said Tidman starting.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Miss
Pewsey, her eyes glittering.</p>

<p>"I mean, just nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do. Make a clean breast of it
Benjamin Tidman. Oh, to think that the son of a
farmer, who was almost a labourer, should dare to
speak evil of a Pewsey of Essex. But the law&mdash;the
law," said the irate lady shaking a thin finger, "and
five thousand pounds."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get it out of the fan."</p>

<p>"Is it worth that?" asked Forge coldly.</p>

<p>"You heard what young Ainsleigh said," answered
Tidman as coldly.</p>

<p>"Yes I remember; but we have not come about
the price, but about your libel on this lady."</p>

<p>"I apologise," said Tidman, seeing nothing else
was to be done.</p>

<p>"Apology isn't money," snapped Miss Pewsey.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you want money, again I refer you to the
fan."</p>

<p>The Major was getting angry. He didn't very
much care if Miss Pewsey did bring an action at
the moment, though with saner thoughts he would
have been horrified at the idea. "I apologise,"
said he again, "but I was misled by Dr. Forge."</p>

<p>"How were you misled by me?" demanded Forge
impassively.</p>

<p>"You said you had the fan in your cabinet, and
that it had been stolen. Mrs. Bressy swore she did
not take it, and I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I was the thief," cried Miss Pewsey
shrilly, "oh how clever of you&mdash;how very, very
clever. You thought that I got the key from the
watch-chain of Dr. Forge where he always carries
it, to open the cabinet and steal a fan, I knew
nothing about it. I never even knew of the existence
of the fan&mdash;there Judas," snapped the lady once
more.</p>

<p>"Then I was mistaken, and Dr. Forge was
mistaken also."</p>

<p>"I confess that I did make a mistake," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
doctor with a sad face, "but that does not excuse
your libelling the lady I hope to call my wife. My
memory is not so good as it was, and I fear that the
drugs I take to induce sleep have impaired what
memory I have left. I suffer from neuralgia,"
added the doctor turning to Miss Pewsey, "and in
China I contracted the habit of opium smoking,
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marriage will put that right," said the lady
patting his hand. "I do not expect a perfect
husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never knew you expected a husband at all,"
said Tidman injudiciously.</p>

<p>"Ho," cried Miss Pewsey drawing herself up.
She had been standing all the time, "another libel.
I call Dr. Forge to witness it."</p>

<p>"I really think Tidman you'd better hold your
tongue," said the doctor gently, "but I must explain,
that I quite forgot that I had parted with the fan.
Yes. I received it from you, seven years ago when
I brought you home after that adventure in Canton.
Two years later I returned to China, to see Lo-Keong
on business, and I took the fan with me.
He received it."</p>

<p>"No," said the Major shaking his bald head, "I
can't believe that, Forge. You declared that you
hated Lo-Keong and that the fan would harm you
and him also."</p>

<p>"I do hate the man," cried Forge looking more
like a bird of prey than ever, "but I got a concession
about a gold mine, by giving back the fan. I
wanted the money more than Lo-Keong's life. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
to my own life, it was in danger from the enemies
of the Mandarin, who want the fan to ruin him.
That was why I spoke as I did. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," said Tidman who was puzzled, "how
did the fan come to England again?"</p>

<p>"My nephew Mr. Burgh will tell you that," said
Miss Pewsey, "when he has administered the beating
I have asked him to inflict."</p>

<p>"Beating," shouted the Major snatching a knife
from the breakfast table, "let that young whelp
dare to hint such a thing, and I'll kick him round
Marport."</p>

<p>"Clarence is not the man to be kicked."</p>

<p>"Nor am I the man to be beaten. I have apologised
and that is quite enough. If you are not
satisfied Miss Pewsey, you can bring your action
and I'll defend it. Beating indeed," snorted Tidman,
"I'd like to see anyone who would dare to lay a
hand on me," and he looked very fierce as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Miss Pewsey in a stately
manner, "if you will tell me all about the fan, I
shall ask Clarence to spare you the beating."</p>

<p>"Clarence can go to&mdash;" the Major mentioned a
place which made Miss Pewsey shriek and clap her
fingers to her ears. "I am not the least afraid of
that cad and bounder&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Libel again Major Tidman."</p>

<p>"Pooh&mdash;Pooh," said Forge rising, "let us go
Lavinia."</p>

<p>"Not till I hear about the fan. For the sake of
my dear Sophia who has the fan, I want to hear."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"All I know, is, that the fan was advertised
for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw the advertisement," said Miss Pewsey,
"but I said nothing to dear Sophia, although I
recognized the fan from the description in the newspaper.
She never looks at the papers, and trusts to
me to tell her the news."</p>

<p>"So you kept from her a piece of news out of
which she could make five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Really and truly," said Miss Pewsey clutching
her bag convulsively and with glittering eyes, "who
says so&mdash;who pays it&mdash;who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"One question at a time," interrupted Tidman, now
quite master of himself. "Tung-yu, the man
Ainsleigh saw at the Joss House in Perry Street
Whitechapel, offered five thousand pounds for the
return of the fan. Ainsleigh saw the advertisement
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know how he came to inquire about the fan,"
said Miss Pewsey, "Dr. Forge told me, but I did not
know the amount offered."</p>

<p>"Will you tell Miss Wharf now."</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Pewsey very decisively, "nor
will any one else. My Sophia's health is delicate
and if she had a shock like that inflicted on her,
she would die."</p>

<p>"What the offer of five thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The chance of being killed," said Miss Pewsey,
"but I will leave my nephew Mr. Burgh to explain
that Major Tidman. I accept your apology for thinking
me a&mdash;but no," cried the lady, "I can't bring
myself to pronounce the nasty word. I am a Pewsey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of Essex. All is said in that, I think. Good
morning, Major. My abstinence from bringing an
action lies in the fact, that you will refrain from unsettling
my Sophia's mind by telling about the fan.
Good-morning. My Theophilus will we not go?"</p>

<p>Before the Major could recover from the bewilderment
into which he was thrown by this torrent
of words, Miss Pewsey taking the arm of the
melancholy doctor had left the room. When alone
Tidman scratched his chin and swore. "There's
something in this," he soliloquised. "I believe the
old woman wants to get the money herself. By
George, I'll keep my eyes on her," and the Major
shook his fist at the door, through which the fairy
form of Miss Pewsey had just vanished.</p>

<p>Later in the day Tidman dressed to perfection,
walked up the town twirling his stick, and beaming
on every pretty woman he came across. The stout
old boy was not at all appalled by the threat of Miss
Pewsey regarding her buccaneering nephew's attentions.
When he saw the gentleman in question
bearing down on him, he simply stopped and grasped
his stick more firmly. If there was to be a fight, the
Major resolved to have the first blow. But Burgh
did not seem ready to make a dash. He sauntered
up to Tidman and looked at him smilingly, "Well
met old pard," said he in his slangy fashion.</p>

<p>"My name to you, is Major Tidman," said the
old fellow coolly.</p>

<p>"I guess I know that much. Can't we go a stretch
along the lower part of the town?"</p>

<p>"If there's any row to come off," said the Major,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
keeping a wary eye on the young man. "I prefer it to
take place here. On guard sir&mdash;on guard."</p>

<p>Clarence shrugged his shoulders and produced a
cigarette. "Oh that's all right," said he striking a
match. "I guess my old aunt's been at you. I'm not
going in for any row&mdash;not me."</p>

<p>"Just as well for you," said the Major sharply,
"how dare you threaten me, you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now I ask you," said Clarence, "if I have
threatened you? Go slow. I guess the old girl's been
piling on the agony. She's got old Forge to fight
her battles. When I make trouble," added Clarence
musingly, "it will be for a pretty girl like Olivia."</p>

<p>"You can have your desire for a row by telling
that to young Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Huh," said Burgh with contempt, "I guess
I'd lay him out pretty smart. I tell you, Major,
I'm dead gone on that girl: but she treats me like a
lump of mud."</p>

<p>"And quite right too," said Tidman coolly, "you
aren't worthy of her. Now Ainsleigh is."</p>

<p>Clarence pitched away his cigarette with an
irritable gesture. "Don't get me riz," said he
darkly, "or I'll make the hair fly with Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Pooh. He's quite able to look after himself."</p>

<p>"Can he shoot?" demanded the buccaneer.</p>

<p>"Yes. And use his fists, and fence, and lay you
out properly. Confound you, sir, don't you think
I've travelled also. I've been in the Naked Lands
in my time, and have seen your sort growing on the
banana plants. You're the sort to get lynched."</p>

<p>"Oh, tie it up," said Burgh with sudden anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
for these remarks were not to his mind. "I want
to tell you about the fan."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to talk of that?" asked Tidman
with suspicion, "I don't care a straw for the
fan."</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon you do, Major. But you're well
out of it. If you'd kept that fan there would have
been trouble&mdash;yes, you may look, but if you'd held
on to that article you'd have been a corpse by
now."</p>

<p>Tidman sneered, not at all terrified by these vague
threats. "What do you mean by this drivel?"</p>

<p>"Let's come to anchor here," said Clarence pulling
up beside a seat in a secluded part, near the old
town beach. "I'll spin the yarn."</p>

<p>"About the fan," said the Major sitting promptly.
"I confess I am curious to know how it came to
England again, after Forge took it again to the Far
East. Didn't he give it to Lo-Keong?"</p>

<p>"So he says," said Clarence with a side-long look
at his companion. "I don't know myself. All I
know is, that I got it from a pirate."</p>

<p>"From a pirate?"</p>

<p>"That's so. I was in Chinese waters a year or
so ago, and I reckon pirates swarm in those parts&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tidman shivered. "Yes," he admitted, "I had
an adventure myself in Canton with a pirate of sorts."</p>

<p>"Old Forge told me something about it," said
Clarence lighting a fresh cigarette, "but my yarn's
different. I was out with some of the boys in
Chinese water, and a pirate tried to board us. We
were down Borneo way, looking out for a ruby mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
said to be in those parts. My pals&mdash;there were two
of them, and myself engineering the job&mdash;hired a
boat and cut across to Borneo. The pirates tried
to slit our throats and our Chinese crew tried to
help them. But we used our Winchesters and six
shooters freely, and shot a heap. The pirates cleared
off and we brought our barky into port safe enough."</p>

<p>"But about the fan?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that. The Boss pirate was shot
by me&mdash;a big six foot Northern Chinee, got up, to
kill, like a tin god. He had this jade fan, and
directed operations with it. When his pals cleared
I found him as dead as a coffin and nailed the fan.
It was pretty enough, but didn't appeal to me much.
I clapped it away in my box, and when I reached
England I offered it to Aunt Lavinia. She wants me
to marry Miss Rayner, and said I should offer it to
her, and cut out that aristocratic Ainsleigh chap.
Olivia&mdash;ripping name, ain't it&mdash;well, she didn't catch
on, so I thought I'd gain the goodwill of old Miss
Wharf, and passed it along to her."</p>

<p>The Major listened in silence to this story, which
seemed reasonable enough. "Strange it should
have come back to England, and to a small place
like this, where Forge had it," he mused. "A
coincidence I suppose. By the way did you see the
advertisement?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You bet I did, and it made me sick to think I'd
parted with the fan. Leastways, it made me sick
till I saw Hwei!"</p>

<p>"You mean Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I mean the Chinee as calls him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>self
Hwei, who put that advertisement in every
newspaper in London, and the United Kingdom."</p>

<p>"What, in everyone?" said the Major, "must
have cost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A heap you bet, Major. Well I struck Hwei&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the name of a river, man."</p>

<p>"Maybe: but it's what this celestial calls himself.
I struck him near the Mansion House, and
knew him of old in Pekin I reckon, where we chin-chined
over some contraband biznai. I spoke to
him in Chinese&mdash;I know enough to get along on&mdash;and
he told me he had come to this country about
Lo-Keong's fan. I never said I'd got it, though by
that time I'd seen the advertisement. I know
Chinamen too well, to give myself away in that
fashion. I pumped him, and learned that Hwei
intended to scrag the chap who held the fan, so I
concluded to lie low."</p>

<p>"But he offered wealth to whomsoever gave it
up."</p>

<p>"Maybe. I don't know exactly how the thing
figures out. I guess Hwei does the killing, and
Tung-yu the rewarding. But you can take it from
me, Major, that unless Miss Wharf gets rid of that
fan she'll have her throat cut. So I guess, you
must be glad you didn't handle the biznai," and
Clarence puffed a serene cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"It's more of a mystery than ever," said the
Major. And so it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Warning</span></h4>


<p>The idea that the end of the year would see him
ruined and homeless was terrible to Rupert. Even
if his home had been an ordinary house, he would
have been anxious; but when he thought of the
venerable mansion, of the few acres remaining, of
the once vast Ainsleigh estates, of the ruins of the
Abbey which he loved, his heart was wrung with
anguish. How could he let these things depart
from him, for ever? Yet he saw no way out of the
matter, although he had frequent consultations with
his lawyers. One day, shortly before the ball at
the Bristol, he returned from town with a melancholy
face. Old Petley ventured to follow his
young master into the library, and found him with
his face covered with his hands, in deep despair.</p>

<p>"Don't take on so, Master Rupert," said the old
butler, gently, "things have not yet come to the
worst."</p>

<p>"They are about as bad as they can be, John,"
replied Ainsleigh. "I have seen Mr. Thorp. It
will take thirty thousand pounds to put matters
right. And where am I to get it? Oh," the young
man started up and walked to and fro, "why didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
I go into the law, or take to some profession where
I might make money? Forge was my guardian, he
should have seen to it."</p>

<p>"Master Rupert," said the old butler, "do you
think that gentleman is your friend?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think he isn't, John?"</p>

<p>Petley pinched his chin between a shaky finger
and thumb. "He don't seem like a friend," said
he in his quavering voice. "He didn't tell you or
me, Master Rupert, how bad things were. When
you was at college he should have told you, and
then you might have learned some way of getting
money."</p>

<p>"My father trusted him, John. He was appointed
my guardian by the will my father made before he
left for China."</p>

<p>"And Dr. Forge went with the master to China,"
said the old man, "how did the master die?"</p>

<p>"Of dysentery, so Dr. Forge says."</p>

<p>"And others say he was murdered."</p>

<p>"Who says so, John?"</p>

<p>"Well sir, that Mandarin gentleman sent your
father's papers and luggage back here when your
mother was alive. A Chinaman brought the things.
He hinted that all was not right, and afterwards
the mistress died. She believed your father was
murdered."</p>

<p>Rupert looked pensive. He had heard something
of this, but the story had been so vague, and was so
vague as John told it, that he did not believe in it
much. "Does Dr. Forge know the truth?" he
asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"He ought to, sir. Dr. Forge came from China
with a report of this gold mine up in Kan-su, and
your father was all on fire to go there and make
money. The mistress implored him not to go but
he would. He went with Dr. Forge, and never
returned. The doctor, I know, says that the master
died of dysentery, when the doctor himself was at
Pekin. But I never liked that Forge," cried the
old servant vehemently, "and I believe there's
something black about the business."</p>

<p>"But why should Forge be an enemy of my
father's?"</p>

<p>"Ah sir," Petley shook his old head, "I can't
rightly say. Those two were at college together
and fast friends; but I never liked Forge. No, sir,
not if I was killed for it would I ever like that
gentleman, though it's not for a person in my position
to speak so. I asked the doctor again and
again to let me know how bad things were, when
you were at school, Master Rupert, but he told me
to mind my own business. As if it wasn't my
business to see after the family I'd been bred up in,
since fifteen years of age."</p>

<p>"I'll have a talk with Dr. Forge," said Rupert
after a pause, "if there is any question of my father
having been murdered, I'll see if he knows," he
turned and looked on the old man quickly. "You
don't suppose John that if there was a murder,
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried Petley hurriedly, "I don't say
he had to do with it. But that Mandarin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong. Why Forge hates him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"So he says. But this Mandarin, as I've heard
from the Major, is high in favour with the Chinaman's
court. If the doctor was his enemy, he could
not go so often to China as he does. And since
your father's death fifteen years ago, he's been back
several times."</p>

<p>"Well I'll speak to him, John."</p>

<p>"And about the money, sir?"</p>

<p>Rupert sat down again. "I don't know what to
do," he groaned. "I can manage to stave off many
of the creditors, but if Miss Wharf forecloses the
mortgage at Christmas everyone will come down
with a rush and I'll have to give up Royabay to the
creditors."</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never&mdash;that will never be," said John
fiercely, "why the place has been under the Ainsleighs
for over three hundred years."</p>

<p>"I don't think that matters to the creditors,"
said Rupert wincing, "if I could only raise this
thirty-thousand and get the land clear I would be
able to live fairly well. There wouldn't be much;
still I could keep the Abbey and we could live
quietly."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> sir?" asked the old man raising his
head.</p>

<p>Rupert flushed, seeing he had made a slip. He
did not want to tell the old man that he was married,
as he was fearful lest the news should come to Miss
Wharf's ears and render his wife's position with
that lady unbearable. "I might get married you
know," he said in an evasive way.</p>

<p>"Lord, sir," cried Petley in terror, "whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
you do, don't cumber yourself with a wife, till you
put things straight."</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows how I am to put them
straight," sighed Rupert. "I say, John, send me in
some tea. I'm quite weary. Thorp is coming to
see me next week and we'll have a talk."</p>

<p>"With Dr. Forge I hope," said old John, as he
withdrew.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh frowned, when the door closed. Petley
certainly seemed possessed by the idea that Forge
was an enemy of the Ainsleighs, yet Rupert could
think of no reason why he should be. He had been
an excellent guardian to the boy, and if he had not
told him the full extent of the ruin till it was too
late to prevent it, he might have done so out of pity,
so that the lad's young years might be unclouded.
"Still it would have been better had he been less
tender of my feelings and more considerate for my
position," thought Rupert as he paced the long
room.</p>

<p>While he was sadly looking out of the window
and thinking of the wrench it would be to leave
the old place, he saw a tall woman walking up the
avenue. The eyes of love are keen, and Rupert
with a thrill of joy recognised the stately gait of
Olivia. With an ejaculation of delight, he ran out,
nearly upsetting Mrs. Petley who was coming into
the Library with a dainty tea. Disregarding her
exclamation of astonishment, Rupert sprang out of
the door and down the steps. He met Olivia half
way near the ruins of the Abbey. "My dearest,"
he said stretching out both hands, "how good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
you to come!" Olivia, who looked pale, allowed him
to take her hands passively. "I want to speak to
you," she said quickly, "come into the Abbey," and
she drew him towards the ruins.</p>

<p>"No! No," said her husband, "enter your own
house and have a cup of tea. It is just ready and
will do you good."</p>

<p>"Not just now, Rupert," she replied, laying a detaining
hand on his arm. "I can wait only for a
quarter of an hour. I must get back."</p>

<p>Rupert grumbled at the short time, but, resolved
to make the most of it, he walked with her into the
cloisters. These were small but the ruins were very
beautiful. Rows of delicately carved pillars surrounded
a grassy sward. At the far end were the
ruins of the church stretching into the pines. The
roofless fane looked venerable even in the bright
sunshine. The walls were overgrown with ivy, and
some of the images over the door, still remained,
though much defaced by Time. The windows were
without the painted glass which had once filled
them, but were rich with elaborate stone work.
This was especially fine in the round window over
the altar. As in the cloisters, the body of the church
was overgrown with grass and some of the pillars
had fallen. The lovers did not venture into the
ruined church itself but walked round the pavement
of the cloisters under the arches. Doubtless in days
of old, many a venerable father walked on that paved
way. But the monks were gone, the shrine was in
ruins, and these lovers of a younger generation paced
the quiet cloisters talking of love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"My darling," said the young husband fondly,
"how pale you are. I hope nothing is wrong."</p>

<p>"My aunt is ill. Oh it's nothing&mdash;only a feverish
cold. She hopes to be well enough to attend the
ball to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"I did not hear of it," said Rupert, "though
Tidman generally tells me the news. I have been
in London for the last few days."</p>

<p>"So I see," said Olivia, and glanced at her fair
stalwart husband in his frock coat and smart Bond
street kit, "how well you look."</p>

<p>Rupert appreciated the compliment and taking her
hands kissed both several times. Olivia bent
forward and pressed a kiss on his smooth hair.
Then she withdrew her hands. "We must talk
sense," she said severely.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Rupert making a wry face, "not about
your aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I can't understand her. She has shut
herself up in her room and refuses to see me. She
will admit no one but Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh shrugged his shoulders. "What does
it matter," he said, "you know Miss Wharf never
liked you. You are much too handsome, my own.
And that is the reason also, for Miss Pewsey's
dislike."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Pewsey is more amiable," said Olivia,
"indeed I never knew her to be so amiable. She is
always chatting to me at such times as she can be
spared from my aunt's room."</p>

<p>"Well, what is worrying you?"</p>

<p>"This exclusion from Aunt Sophia's room,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
said Olivia with tears of vexation in her dark eyes.
"I am her only relative&mdash;or at all events I am her
nearest. It seems hard that she should exclude
me, and admit Miss Pewsey who is only a paid
companion."</p>

<p>"I don't think it matters a bit," said Rupert,
"hasn't your aunt seen anyone lately?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;yes, by the way. She has seen her lawyer
several times."</p>

<p>"I expect she is altering her will."</p>

<p>Olivia laughed. "She threatens to do so in
favour of Miss Pewsey, unless by the end of the
month I give you up, and engage myself either to
Mr. Walker or to Mr. Burgh."</p>

<p>Rupert grew very angry. "What a detestable
woman," he exclaimed. "I beg your pardon, dear,
I forgot she's your aunt. But what right has she
to order you about like this? You are of age."</p>

<p>"And I am married, though she doesn't know it.
But I'll tell you the real reason, I am vexed I can't
see my aunt. Can't we sit down?"</p>

<p>"Over there," said Ainsleigh, pointing to a secluded
seat.</p>

<p>It was placed at the far end of the cloisters under
a large oak. There were four oaks here, or to be
more correct, three oaks and the stump of one.
"That was destroyed by lightning when I was
born," said Rupert, seeing Olivia's eyes fixed on
this. "Mrs. Petley saw in it an omen that I would
be unlucky. But am I?" and he fell to kissing his
wife's hands again.</p>

<p>"Really, Rupert, you must be more sensible,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
she said, in pretended vexation. "What a pretty
tree that copper-beech is."</p>

<p>"Yes! But do you see the blackened
square?"</p>

<p>"It is not so very black," said Mrs. Ainsleigh,
pausing to dig the point of her umbrella into the
ground, "there's hardly any grass on it, and the
earth is dark and hard. Curious it should be so,
seeing the grass is thick and green all round, I
suppose this is where Abbot Raoul was burnt."</p>

<p>"Yes. I've told you the story and shown you
the spot many times," said Rupert, slipping his
arm round her waist.</p>

<p>"Dearest," she whispered, "I was too much in
love, to hear what you said on that point. And
remember, all my visits to the Abbey have been
secret ones. My aunt would be furious did she
know that I had been here, and I often wonder that
Pewsey, who is always watching me, has not
followed me here."</p>

<p>"If she does I'll duck her in the pond for a witch,"
said Rupert, and drew his wife to the seat under the
oak, "well, go on."</p>

<p>"About my aunt. Oh, it's what Major Tidman
told me. He's been trying to see Aunt Sophia also.
Have you heard what Mr Burgh told the Major
about that horrid fan?"</p>

<p>"No. You forget, I have just returned from town.
What is it?"</p>

<p>Olivia related to Rupert the story which Clarence
had told the Major. "So you see," she ended,
"this man Hwei wants to kill any one who has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
fan, and Tung-yu desires to reward the person who
brings it back."</p>

<p>"It seems contradictory," said Ainsleigh thoughtfully,
"and if Hwei put in the advertisement it is
strange that Tung-yu should have received me in
the Joss-house mentioned in the paper. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Olivia rather vexed, "can't you see.
I want my aunt to know that she is in danger and
get rid of that horrid fan."</p>

<p>"Pooh," said her husband laughing, "there's no
danger. Hwei can't kill an old lady like that for
the sake of a fan she would probably sell for five
shillings."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't," said Olivia with conviction.
"Aunt Sophia has taken quite a fancy to that fan.
But she ought to be told how dangerous it is, Rupert."</p>

<p>"Or how lucky," said Ainsleigh, "let her sell the
fan to Tung-yu for five thousand pounds and then
she can let Hwei kill Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"But would he do so."</p>

<p>"I can't say. On the face of it, it looks as though
these two were working against one another, seeing
they propose to reward the owner of the fan in such
different ways. Yet Hwei, according to Burgh, put
the advertisement in and Tung-yu received me. I
don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you think I should tell the whole
story to my aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Go in and see her."</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey won't let me, and my aunt refuses
to admit me. I sent in a note the other day saying
that I wished to speak very particularly, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
sent out another note to say that she would not see
anyone till she was well. The note was kind enough
in Aunt Sophia's cold way, but you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Well then let Tidman see her."</p>

<p>"Rupert, how annoying you are. She won't see
anyone but Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey. Well then, tell her the story,
and she can repeat it to your aunt. Though, by
the way," added Ainsleigh, "Burgh may have told
Miss Pewsey about it already."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olivia, her face brightening, and
rising to go away, "but I'll ask Miss Pewsey to tell
Aunt Sophia herself."</p>

<p>As they walked towards the ruined entrance, Mrs.
Petley's bulky form appeared in the archway. She
threw up her hands. "Sakes alive, Master Rupert,
come off Abbot Raoul's burning-place."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh, who was standing on the square of
blackened ground, obeyed at once, and drew Olivia
away also. "I forgot," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Forgot what?" asked Olivia.</p>

<p>"Why miss," said the old housekeeper, "don't
you know it's said that if an Ainsleigh stands there,
some trouble will befall him before the year's end,
You're not an Ainsleigh miss, but Master Rupert&mdash;well
there&mdash;oh sir, how can you be so foolish. The
tea's ready sir," and Mrs. Petley, with this prosaic
ending trotted away.</p>

<p>"She doesn't know that you are an Ainsleigh,"
said Rupert kissing his wife, "pah, Don't think of
that foolish superstition. Come to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Rupert," said Olivia, planting herself firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
against the wall, "you know I said a quarter of an
hour. It's half an hour we have been talking. I
must get back."</p>

<p>The young husband urged, implored, scolded,
cajoled, but all to no effect. Olivia made up her
mind to go, and go she did, Rupert escorting her to
the gates. "You are very unkind," he said.</p>

<p>"I am very sensible," she replied, "I don't want
to disturb my new relations with Miss Pewsey. She
has such power over my aunt that it is necessary I
should keep on good terms with her. Now, Rupert,
you must not come any further."</p>

<p>"Just along the road."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. All the gossips of Marport
would talk. Good-bye. I won't be kissed again.
Someone may be looking."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh muttered a blessing on anyone who
might be about, and shook hands with his wife just
as though they were strangers. Then he remained
at the gate till she turned the corner. There, she
looked back and Rupert threw her a kiss. Olivia
shook a furious sunshade at him for the indiscretion.</p>

<p>"The silly boy," she said to herself as she went
along, "if anyone saw him, there would be a fine
story all over Marport."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Beginning of the Ball</span></h4>


<p>So this was the position of affairs immediately
before the ball given by the Glorious Golfers at the
Bristol Hotel. Miss Wharf possessed the fan, and
two Chinamen were searching for it. Hwei intended
to secure it by murder, and Tung-yu by the milder
means of honourable purchase: but why the two, with
such contradictory intentions, should work in unison,
as appeared from the advertisement, Rupert could
not understand. However, he had so much trouble
himself that he dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>There was little chance of his benefiting by money
from the one Chinaman, or of being murdered by the
other. And he presumed that Olivia would instruct
Miss Pewsey to tell Miss Wharf about the fan, even
if she did not see her personally. And while Miss
Wharf was ill and safe in her house, Hwei could not
get at her in any way. Moreover, as Burgh in his
interview with Hwei near the Mansion House, had
held his tongue, the man would not know where the
fan was.</p>

<p>The ball was the best of the Marport season, as the
Glorious Golfers were a body of young men with
plenty of money and a great love of amusement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>The vast apartments of the Bristol were thrown
open, and decked with flowers; an Irish Band,&mdash;The
Paddies,&mdash;was engaged from London, and many
people came down from the great city to be present.</p>

<p>It was a perfect night when the ball was held, and
the terrace on the first floor of the hotel, or to speak
more properly the balcony, was thronged with people.</p>

<p>It looked very pretty, as it was filled with tropical
ferns and plants and trees, illuminated with Chinese
lanterns and made comfortable with numerous arm
chairs, and plenty of small marble-topped tables.</p>

<p>Between the dances, people finding the rooms too
warm, came out to walk in the night air. There
was no moon, but the night was starry and warm,
and a soft luminous light was reflected on sea and
land. Standing under the great fern-trees and amidst
the fairy lights, the guests could survey with pleasure
the vast waste of water stretching towards the clear
horizon, and see the long pier glittering with innumerable
lights. Needless to say, the terrace was
much frequented by amorous couples.</p>

<p>Within, the ball-room, gay with flowers and
draperies, with a waxed floor and many electric
light in coloured globes, looked very pretty. The
band was hidden behind a lofty floral screen, and
played the latest seductive waltzes, interspersed with
inspiriting barn-dances and quaint cake-walks. The
women were lovely, and the dresses perfect, so the
young men enjoyed themselves not a little. Rupert
was present, looking handsome in his evening dress,
but rather flushed and anxious. He was not sure
if Miss Wharf would come, in which case Olivia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
would not be present. And, if the old maid did
recover sufficiently to make her appearance, she
would perhaps refuse to allow him to dance with
the girl.</p>

<p>However Miss Wharf did appear though at
a somewhat late hour. She was gowned in pale
blue and looked very handsome, if somewhat stout.
Olivia's dark beauty revealed itself in a primrose-hued
dress, and Miss Pewsey looked more like a
witch than ever in a black frock glittering with jet.
This was the gift of Miss Wharf, as poor Miss Pewsey
would never have been able to indulge in such
extravagance. At the back and in attendance on
the Ivy Lodge party, were Clarence Burgh and Dr.
Forge. The buccaneer looked picturesque and
dashing as usual and was dressed very quietly for one
of his flamboyant tastes, though he showed to disadvantage
beside the perfection of Rupert's garb. Forge
wore a suit which might have been made for his
grandfather, and which fitted his lank form ill. The
doctor looked less his cool self, than was usually the
case. His parchment face was flushed and his
melancholy eyes glittered as they roved round the
brilliant room. Rupert wondered if he was looking
for Tung-yu, and glanced round the room himself to
see if the Chinaman had arrived in Chris Walker's
company. But he could not perceive him.</p>

<p>Putting his fortune to the test, and having come
to no open rupture with the lady, Rupert boldly
walked up to Miss Wharf and offered his hand. She
gave him rather a peculiar look and coloured a
little. But to his secret satisfaction she received him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
very kindly. Olivia took her husband's greeting
with a quiet smile, rather cold, as she knew well
Miss Pewsey was watching her face. As to that
lady, she hovered round the group like an ugly old
fairy, about to weave the spell.</p>

<p>"And where is the Major?" asked Miss Pewsey
in her emphatic way, "surely he is present on this
occasion."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that the Major is laid up with
a bad cold," said Rupert. "I have just been to see
him. He is not coming."</p>

<p>"A cold spoils his beauty," tittered Miss Pewsey,
"dear me, how very vain that man is."</p>

<p>"A cold has not spoilt Miss Wharf's beauty at
all events," said Ainsleigh, seeing his way to a compliment.
"I never saw you look so well," he added
with a bow.</p>

<p>"Thanks to Lavinia's nursing," laughed the lady.
"Olivia can you keep still while that delicious music
is playing. I'm sure Mr. Burgh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think Miss Rayner is engaged to me," put in
Rupert promptly.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf tapped him on the shoulder with the
very fan, about which there had been so much talk.
"No I can't spare you," she said amiably. "I want
to chat with you. Olivia?"</p>

<p>The girl exchanged a look with her husband and
saw that his eyes were fastened on the fan. Resolved
to give him a chance of talking to her aunt
about it, she moved away on the arm of the buccaneer
to join in the whirling throng. Forge offered his
arm to Miss Pewsey, not to dance, but to escort her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
on to the terrace, and so it came about that aunt
Sophia and Rupert were left alone in a quiet corner
of the room.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf cast a side glance at the young man
and seeing how handsome and gay he was, she
heaved a sigh. Perhaps she was thinking of his
father whom she had loved dearly, but if so, the
emotion was only momentary, for she compressed
her lips and drew herself up stiffly. "Mr. Ainsleigh,"
she said, "you never come to see me now.
How is that?"</p>

<p>"I thought you did not wish to see me," said
Rupert frankly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes I do. Your father was an old friend of
mine, and for his sake I wish to be kind to you."</p>

<p>Rupert saw that she was unaware that he had
met Olivia secretly, and had heard the story of the
early romance. It was not wise, he thought, to
bring up the subject, so he met her on her own
ground. "You can be very kind to me if you wish,"
he said casting a significant glance on Olivia who
floated past with Burgh.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf followed his gaze and frowned, shaking
her head. "No," she said severely, "you must
give up the idea of marrying Olivia."</p>

<p>"I can't do that," replied Rupert, thinking of his
secret marriage, "and I don't see why you should
refuse to let me love her."</p>

<p>"I can't prevent that," snapped Miss Wharf,
"love her as much as you choose, but as another
man's wife," and again she looked oddly at Rupert,
who wondered what she meant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"What an immoral remark," he said, "perhaps
you will explain."</p>

<p>"Mr. <ins title="Ansliegh">Ainsleigh</ins> I will be frank with you," said
the lady calmly, "you have no money, and are liable
to lose Royabay. I hold a mortgage it is true and
by the end of the year I can <ins title="forclose">foreclose</ins>; but that, I
shall not do if you give up Olivia. If I foreclose,
you know well enough that your other creditors will
come down on you, and you will lose all. I hold
the scales," added she significantly.</p>

<p>"I see that well enough Miss Wharf, but many
things may happen before the end of the year."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will get the money to pay me
and others?"</p>

<p>"I might even mean that," answered Rupert coolly,
"and if I am a bad match, I don't think Mr. Burgh
is a better. I have at least a position and a clean
name."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Clarence Burgh?" she
asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, save that he is an adventurer, Miss
Wharf. He comes from no-where, and swaggers
about Marport as if it belonged to him. He has no
recognised position and he is not a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh but he is, and I want him to marry
Olivia."</p>

<p>"And thus you would condemn Olivia to misery.
She loves me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A girl's love," said Miss Wharf coolly, "she'll
soon get over that. Mr. Burgh is Lavinia's nephew,
and I have promised Lavinia that Olivia shall be
his wife."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why in heaven's name?" asked Rupert angrily,
"he has no money."</p>

<p>"Oh yes he has, and may have a chance of getting
more. Lavinia has been a good friend to me for
years and years&mdash;all my life in fact, Mr. Ainsleigh.
I owe much to her, and I intend to repay her. Her
heart is set on this match and Olivia must marry
Clarence."</p>

<p>"Olivia shall not."</p>

<p>"Olivia shall. I set my will against yours Mr.
Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"You'll find my will is stronger," said Rupert
coolly.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf gave a short laugh. "Try," she
said curtly; then her hard eyes softened and her
cold manner grew warmer. "Don't let us quarrel,"
she said gently. "I wish you well, and would give
you anything save Olivia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is the only thing I want."</p>

<p>"How rude of you to call Olivia a 'thing,'" said the
woman lightly, "you may make up your mind that
if you marry her, I shall leave my money to Miss
Pewsey."</p>

<p>"Do so. I don't want your money."</p>

<p>"Five hundred a year is not enough," sneered
Miss Wharf, "but I may have more. What do
you say to five thousand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," interrupted Rupert coolly, "so Olivia has
told you about the fan&mdash;or perhaps Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>"It was Olivia. I believe Clarence Burgh told
her. This fan," Miss Wharf unfurled the article,
"means five thousand pounds&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or a cut throat," said Rupert quickly.</p>

<p>"Pah! how foolish you are, as though such a
thing could happen in England. Were we in China
I admit that I should be afraid to keep this fan; but
as it is I am perfectly safe. See here, Mr. Ainsleigh,"
she added bending towards him, "if you will give
up Olivia I will give you this fan and you can get
the money to pay off your creditors."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert at once. "I need thirty
thousand, not five. And even if you were to give
me the thirty thousand I need, I would not sell
Olivia for that sum."</p>

<p>"Look at the fan first," said Miss Wharf and
gave it to him.</p>

<p>Rupert's nerves thrilled as he took the dainty
trifle in his hand. So much had been said about it,
so much hung on it, of the meaning of which he was
ignorant, that he could not look at it without feeling
the drama it represented. Balzac's remark about
killing a Mandarin in China to obtain a fortune,
occurred to his mind. This fan dainty and fragile,
might cost the life of such a Mandarin. It all
depended into whose hands it fell.</p>

<p>The fan was exactly as the advertisement described.
On one side the pale green sticks were
enamelled and smooth; on the other thin slivers of
jade covered the wood, and were inscribed in quaint
Chinese characters in gold. The handle was of
gold, and therefrom hung a thick cord of yellow silk,
with four beads and half a bead thereon. Three
beads and the half one were of jade, but the remaining
ball was of jasper. What these might mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Rupert could not understand, but apparently they
were connected with the secret of the fan, whatever
that might be. Certainly, whatever its significance,
the secret dealt with the life of Lo-Keong, with the life
of Dr. Forge, and with the life of Miss Wharf, seeing
she now possessed the article. All the time Rupert
furled and unfurled the fan, admiring its beauty, she
kept her cold eyes on him. "Think," she whispered,
"five thousand pounds may gain you a few months
respite&mdash;you may be able to save the Abbey."</p>

<p>Rupert shook his head. "If I lose Olivia I don't
care about keeping Royabay. It can be sold up
and I'll go abroad to the Colonies to work for my
living."</p>

<p>"Without Olivia."</p>

<p>"No. With Olivia. Nothing will buy her from
me."</p>

<p>Miss Wharf finding all her arts fail, snatched the
fan from him, and bit her lip. Her eyes flashed,
and she seemed on the point of making some remark,
but refrained. "Very good, Mr. Ainsleigh," said
she. "I'll see what I can do with Olivia. You
have ruined her."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"You'll find out my friend," she replied clenching
the fan fiercely. "Oh, I am not so blind, or so
ignorant as you think me."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh turned crimson. He wondered if by
any chance she had heard of the marriage, and it
was on the tip of his tongue to put a leading question
to Miss Wharf, when Chris Walker came up. He
was not alone. With him was a small Chinaman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with the impassive face of the Celestial. Tung-yu&mdash;as
Rupert guessed he was&mdash;wore a gorgeous yellow
gown, with a kind of blue silk blouse over it. His
feet were encased in thick Chinese shoes wonderfully
embroidered and his pig-tail was down. Several
ladies cast avaricious looks at these gorgeous vestments,
and especially at the blouse, which was
heavy with dragons woven in gold thread. In his
thin yellow hand with long finger-nails, Tung-yu
held a small ivory fan, and he stood impassively
before Miss Wharf, not even casting a look at the
fan in her hand, which he was prepared to buy at
such a large price.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Tung-yu," said Chris boyishly.
"He wants to meet you, Miss Wharf. He admires
English ladies."</p>

<p>"I fear I can't speak his language, Chris."</p>

<p>"He can speak ours to perfection," said
Walker.</p>

<p>Tung-yu bowed politely and spoke in admirably
chosen English. "I was at Cambridge," he said
calmly, "and I know of your Western culture. If
you will permit me, madam." He took a seat beside
Miss Wharf.</p>

<p>Chris, seeing his friend well established looked
around. "Where is Miss Rayner?" he asked.
"Oh there she is&mdash;the dance is over."</p>

<p>And so it was. The dancers were streaming out
on to the balcony and the room was almost empty.
Burgh, with Olivia on his arm, came towards Miss
Wharf, and Chris hurried forward to ask Miss
Rayner for a dance. But quick as he was, Rupert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was quicker. He had seen his wife dance with one
admirer, and was not going to let her dance with
another. "Miss Rayner is engaged to me," he said,
and offered his arm with a defiant look at Burgh, to
whom he had not been introduced.</p>

<p>Burgh showed no disposition to let Olivia go, and
scowled. But his eye fell on the Chinaman seated
by Miss Wharf, and he suddenly moved away. It
seemed to Rupert that the buccaneer was afraid.
Chris remained to protest, but Ainsleigh ended the
matter by abruptly taking Olivia out of the room.
Miss Wharf frowned when she saw them depart
and opened her mouth, as though to call Olivia
back. But on second thoughts she contented herself
with another frown and then turned to speak to
Tung-yu. "I have heard of you," she said.</p>

<p>"From my friend, Mr. Walker," said the polite
Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, and from someone else, through a third
party. I heard of your advertisement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What advertisement?" asked Tung-yu.</p>

<p>"About this fan," and Miss Wharf waved it under
Tung-yu's narrow eyes, which did not change their
expression of indifference.</p>

<p>"I do not understand, Madam!"</p>

<p>The lady looked astonished. "Why. Didn't you
advertise for the fan?"</p>

<p>Tung-yu permitted himself to smile. "Who told
you I did?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mr Ainsleigh, who left just now, told a friend of
mine, who told me," said Miss Wharf. "I understood
you wished to possess this fan."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Tung-yu indifferently, "the advertisement
was placed in the paper, by a compatriot of
mine called Hwei. He asked me to see anyone who
called about it, as he was engaged. I saw Mr
Ainsleigh and told him what he told your friend.
You must apply to Hwei."</p>

<p>"And have my life taken," said Miss Wharf with
a shudder.</p>

<p>This time the Chinaman was not able to suppress
a start. "I do not quite understand, Madam?" he
reflected.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do, Mr Tung-yu. Hwei would
murder me to get this fan. I prefer to sell it to
you for five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>The Chinaman's face became impassive again,
though his eyes looked surprised. "I assure you,
this is quite wrong, Madam. My friend Hwei wants
the fan, because it belongs to a Mandarin who
received it as a gift from his dead wife. So dearly
does this Mandarin prize it, that he is willing to buy
it at any price."</p>

<p>"Even five thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. This Mandarin is rich." He
turned his narrow eyes again on the lady. "Did
the person who said that Hwei would go as far as
crime, tell you the Mandarin's name?"</p>

<p>"No. Who is the Mandarin?"</p>

<p>"I fear I cannot tell you madam. Hwei did not
tell me. If you like I will bring him to you."</p>

<p>Miss Wharf hesitated. Her avarice was aroused
by the hope of getting rid of a trifle for five thousand
pounds but she did not wish to risk herself alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
with a blood-thirsty celestial. "If you will come
also," she said, hesitating.</p>

<p>Tung-yu reflected. "Madam, I will be plain
with you," he said gravely, "as I am here, I can act
on behalf of my friend Hwei&mdash;but to-morrow."</p>

<p>Miss Wharf tendered the fan. "Why not take
it to-night and give me a cheque," she said
quickly.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," replied the Chinaman, rising and
bowing politely, "I will call on you, if you will
permit me. Mr. Walker will show me the way. I
will then arrange to buy the fan at a price to which
you will not object. Meanwhile&mdash;" he bowed again
and gravely departed.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf, rather annoyed and surprised by
this behaviour, looked round for Miss Pewsey, to
whom she was accustomed to tell everything. The
little woman appeared at that moment pushing her
way through the crowd in a state of excitement.
"Oh, Sophia!" she said, throwing herself down.
"Oh, Sophia."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Miss Wharf coldly.</p>

<p>"I might ask you," said Miss Pewsey, parrying
the question, "you look so upset, my Sophia."</p>

<p>"It is with pleasure then," said the old maid,
dryly, "I have arranged to sell this fan to-morrow
for five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Oh," Miss Pewsey clasped her hand, "What
joy; you will be able to add to your income. But,
Sophia, I really can't keep it any longer. That
Major Tidman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well. What about him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Ainsleigh said he had a cold and was confined
to his room. I went up to see, as I don't
trust that Major a bit. He's so wicked. I went to
his room, and peeped in. Sophia," added Miss
Pewsey in a tragic manner. "He is not there&mdash;the
room is empty!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The End of the Ball</span></h4>


<p>Miss Wharf looked at her excited little friend
with an indulgent smile. "Really I don't see why
you should trouble," she said with a smile. "Let
the Major do what he likes."</p>

<p>"He's up to some mischief," persisted the old
maid, "and I'd like to find out what it is. He is
supposed to be keeping his room, because of a cold,
and I find he is not in. People with colds," added
the lady, impressively, "do not go into the night
air."</p>

<p>"How do you know Major Tidman has?"</p>

<p>"Because he would be at the ball, were he in the
hotel. I shall ask Clarence to see what he is
doing."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Miss Wharf, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;oh, just because," replied Miss
Pewsey, tossing her head in a sharp way, like the
Red Queen in Alice's Adventures. "But the fan,
dearest Sophia?&mdash;Can't I take charge of it?"</p>

<p>Miss Wharf grasped the fan tighter. "No, certainly
not. It is worth five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"And perhaps more," said Miss Pewsey. "Remember,
dearest Sophia, that is the sum offered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
but you might ask more. It is very important that
this Mandarin should get the fan back. Dr. Forge
told me."</p>

<p>"Why is it important?"</p>

<p>"Theophilus didn't tell me that, but he said that
this Mandarin&mdash;I quite forget his queer name&mdash;would
give even more than five thousand to get it
back."</p>

<p>"His emissary didn't seem very anxious to buy."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is craft," rejoined Miss Pewsey, tossing
her head. "The Chinese are very double, Theophilus
says."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Lavinia. I would have sold
this fan for a few pounds had I not known such a
large sum was offered. Tung-yu is not a good
business man, or else the Mandarin must be a
millionaire."</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;he is. I wish you would let me conduct
the business, and <i>do</i> let me take the fan?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall keep it."</p>

<p>"Sophia," said Miss Pewsey, solemnly, "that is
dangerous. Rupert Ainsleigh hates you and needs
money; he might kill you to get that fan, and sell
it for five&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. I cannot be murdered in a house
full of people like this. I know another Chinaman
hints at murder&mdash;you told me so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Olivia told me to tell you," put in the little
woman, quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, Hwei isn't here, and I'll sell the fan to
Tung-yu to-morrow."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey would have said more, but at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
moment Dr. Forge approached, with a crooked
elbow and a dreary smile. "Allow me to take you
into supper, Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"Certainly," she rose and took the arm. "I am
really hungry. Lavinia?"</p>

<p>"I shall look for Clarence. I must find out what
has become of Major Tidman," and the old maid
hurried away while the doctor escorted Miss Wharf
to the supper-room.</p>

<p>Clarence was not drinking at the buffet, though
his aunt went there to find him as the most likely
place. Nor was he in the ball-room, although a
new dance had begun. She could not see him in
the card-room, but finally ran him to earth on the
terrace, where he was leaning against a tree-fern
with folded arms and with his wicked black eyes
fixed on a couple some distance away. Miss Pewsey
followed his gaze and her eyes also flashed, for she
beheld Rupert talking with Olivia. Both their
heads were bent, and they conversed earnestly.
The little woman hated Olivia and detested Rupert,
so the sight was gall and worm-wood to her. "Why
don't you ask her to dance?" she demanded, touching
her nephew's arm.</p>

<p>"Because there would only be a row," he rejoined
sullenly. "I feel inclined to spoil that chap's looks
I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Do you really love the girl, so?"</p>

<p>"Yes I do. I'd give anything to marry her, and
I shall too."</p>

<p>"There's not the slightest chance. Ainsleigh
will not surrender her I can tell you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why did you make me waste that fan."</p>

<p>"You didn't waste it on her," said Miss Pewsey
coldly, "she refused to take it like a fool, and now
Sophia has it, there is no chance of getting it back.
Had I known the fan was of such value, you wouldn't
have caught me advising you to part with it. If
you knew what this Hwei said, why didn't you tell
me the fan was valuable."</p>

<p>"I did not see Hwei until I had parted with the
fan," said Clarence crossly, "and we can do nothing
now."</p>

<p>"You are not so bold as Major Tidman," she
whispered.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the buccaneer sharply.</p>

<p>"He's not in his room," rejoined Miss Pewsey in
a low voice, "he pretends illness, to carry out his
plan to get the fan."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because Tung-yu is in the hotel. The Major
will try and get the fan to sell it to him."</p>

<p>"In that case he would have come to the ball and
have seen Miss Wharf to get it from her."</p>

<p>"No. He has some other plan. What it is I
don't know. But I wish you would look round for
him, Clarence, and watch him."</p>

<p>"Bah! It's all stuff." Burgh turned to look at
the sea and the pier and the luminous night. "I'm
getting sick of this business," he went on discontentedly,
"and but for the chance of gaining Olivia, I
would bunk out on the long trail. There's a barky
out there," he continued pointing to the right of the
pier, "yonder&mdash;the one with the green light. I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
her anchor early in the afternoon&mdash;a kind of gentleman's
yacht I fancy. She'd just do for me. I'd like
to take a boat and pull out to her and then get up
steam for the South Seas. There's a clear path leads
there, down channel," and he stared at the flickering
green light which winked amongst many red
ones.</p>

<p>"You'll never get Olivia," said Miss Pewsey, in a
sharp tense voice, "and you can go away as soon as
you like. Meantime, look for Major Tidman and tell
him I want him."</p>

<p>Clarence lazily stretched himself, and moved off
along the balcony. At the end there was a flight of
shallow steps leading down to an iron gate which was
open. Thence one could pass to the Esplanade and
the beach, if so inclined. But the guests kept to the
populous end of the balcony where the lights
clustered. Near the stairs, there were hardly any
lamps, and a screen of flowers curtained it off from
the rest of the hotel. Clarence passed through this
floral arch, and Miss Pewsey lost sight of him. Her
eyes turned to the couple she hated, and she carelessly
moved near them. No one noted her as the
balcony was not so full, and she sat down behind a
fern where she could hear without being seen by the
two, she was spying on. Their voices were low, but
hate sharpened Miss Pewsey's ears, and she listened
intently.</p>

<p>"My aunt is much more amiable to-night," Olivia
was saying, "I suppose the chance of making five
thousand pounds has appealed to her."</p>

<p>"She gave me the chance of making it, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
I gave you up," said Rupert, "and she lost her
temper with me because I declined."</p>

<p>"Will you never be friends with her?"</p>

<p>"I fear not, while Miss Pewsey is in the way,"
said Rupert. "Olivia, it is that woman who makes
all the mischief."</p>

<p>"I think it is," replied the girl with a weary smile,
"but she seems to have a kind of hypnotic power
over my aunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Sophia has bad headaches and Miss
Pewsey sometimes hypnotises her to send away the
pain."</p>

<p>"Miss Wharf is foolish to allow her to do such a
thing. That little woman is no more to be trusted
than her scamp of a nephew is."</p>

<p>"Well it doesn't matter," said Olivia, feeling in
her pocket. "I want to talk about ourselves. See
Rupert you wanted a silk tie the other day. I have
knitted you one&mdash;red and yellow."</p>

<p>Rupert took the tie and admired it in the lamp
light. He would have kissed Olivia's hand after a
few words of warm thanks, but she prevented
him.</p>

<p>"Someone might see and tell Aunt Sophia," she
said hurriedly, "I should have given it to you the
other day when I called at the Abbey, but I forgot,
so I decided to give it to you to-night. It's rather
awkward your having it now. Give it to me again."</p>

<p>"No! I'll put it in my over-coat in the cloak
room," said Rupert, rising, "but I must take you
back to Miss Wharf, or she will be angry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish this deception was at an end and I could
be with you altogether," said Olivia rising with a
sigh.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Miss Pewsey chose to
come forward. She was furious at the way in
which the couple spoke of her, but long habit enabled
her to smooth her face to a treacherous smile.</p>

<p>"Oh dear Olivia," she said. "I have been
looking for you everywhere."</p>

<p>"Does my aunt want me?" asked the girl
calmly.</p>

<p>"No. She is in the supper-room with Mr. Forge.
But Mr. Walker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want him," said Miss Rayner quickly,
and with a change of voice.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said Rupert in a low voice. "Go
with her, and dance with Walker; it will prevent
Miss Wharf being cross."</p>

<p>"Very well," rejoined Olivia quietly: then turned
to Miss Pewsey who smiled like a grotesque image.
"Let us go to the ball-room."</p>

<p>"Won't Mr. Ainsleigh escort us?" asked the old
maid, blandly. Rupert bowed, and smothering his
feelings, which always revolted at the sight of the
woman, he walked beside the two to the ball-room.
Miss Pewsey took Olivia's arm and chattered
effusively all the time. At the door they met Chris
Walker, who hurried up at once and asked for a
dance. Leaving the two ladies with him, Rupert
went towards the cloak room. Here to his surprise
he saw Major Tidman clothed in a heavy fur coat,
talking to Tung-yu. Tidman looked white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
uneasy, but the Chinaman still preserved his impassive
face. Rupert took no notice but simply nodded
to the Major as he passed, pulling out the yellow
and red tie as he did so. Tidman changed colour,
apparently not pleased at being found talking to
Tung-yu, and laughed uneasily. "That's a bright
piece of goods Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"It's a present," said Rupert thrusting the tie
into the pocket of his over coat. "I should think it
would match your friend's dress."</p>

<p>"Hush," said Tidman quietly, "he speaks
English. He will hear," then he added aloud.
"Let me introduce you to Mr. Ainsleigh, Tung-yu."</p>

<p>The Chinaman turned and looked impassive
enough. But his eyes had an enquiring look in their
black depths. "Tung-yu and I met in Canton,
where we had an adventure," said the Major, with a
titter.</p>

<p>"About that famous fan?" asked Rupert smiling.</p>

<p>Tung-yu started and looked quickly at Tidman,
who was again pale. "I don't remember about the
fan," said Tung-yu, "did our friend find it in
Canton?"</p>

<p>"No! No I never did," said Tidman hurriedly,&mdash;"that
is Forge found the fan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And gave it to Miss Wharf. Quite so," replied
Tung-yu blandly. "I see her to-morrow about the
matter," then he bowed to Rupert and moved
away slowly.</p>

<p>"I thought you had a bad cold," said Rupert to
Tidman, who was looking after the Chinaman with a
scared expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but that is better now," said the
Major hurriedly, "so Miss Wharf is here, and has
the fan?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she offered to give it to me if I surrendered
Olivia."</p>

<p>"Refuse&mdash;refuse," cried Tidman hurriedly: he
approached his lips to Ainsleigh's ears. "There is
death in the air to-night."</p>

<p>"Tidman," cried Ainsleigh starting away and
staring.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;say nothing. I wish you hadn't
mentioned about my having the fan. Tung-yu
never knew&mdash;but it can't be helped. Ainsleigh, is
there another Chinaman here to-night?"</p>

<p>"I have seen none. Do you expect Hwei? If
so we had better warn Miss Wharf. She has the
fan and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! No&mdash;say nothing. Don't touch the
accursed thing."</p>

<p>"How do you know it is accursed?"</p>

<p>"I knew in Canton, and in a very unpleasant
way. But I'll tell you my adventure to-morrow&mdash;yes
I will&mdash;if nothing happens to-night."</p>

<p>Rupert stared still harder. "What can happen
to-night man alive?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing," said the Major hurriedly.
"I'll get back to my room&mdash;you needn't say you
have seen me. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just the man I want," cried a bold free voice,
and Burgh's slim hand fell on the Major's shoulder.
"Miss Pewsey asks for you."</p>

<p>"For me. Any more trouble?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess not. She wants to fuss round about
your cold. Heaping coals of fire's the English of
it."</p>

<p>"Let her leave me alone," said the Major petulently.
"I'm quite well. I am going back to my
room," and with a nod to Rupert, he marched
out.</p>

<p>Burgh looked after him with a smile and a shrug:
then he turned to Rupert who was moving towards
the door. "Can I speak with you?" he asked with
a frown.</p>

<p>"Not here Mr. Burgh," cried Ainsleigh, "this is
not the place for a quarrel."</p>

<p>"And why not," cried the other, advancing with
clenched fists, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your distance," said Ainsleigh sharply
starting back on his guard, "the attendant is looking
on," and he pointed to the man behind the counter
who attended to the hats and cloaks.</p>

<p>Burgh tossed him a shilling, "Go and get a
drink," he ordered.</p>

<p>"Stop where you are," commanded Rupert, "or
I'll report you."</p>

<p>But the man, who was a dissipated-looking waiter
pretended not to hear this last remark, and disappeared
from behind the counter. The two men
were alone, and Burgh spoke first. "I guess I'm
going to lay you out," said he, "on account of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop," said Rupert, "mention no names."</p>

<p>"I'll mention what I like and Olivia&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ainsleigh let drive before he could finish the word
and in a second Burgh was sprawling on the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
He rose with an oath and slipped round his right
hand. "You draw a revolver and I'll break your
neck," panted Rupert, "you bully, what do you
mean by&mdash;"</p>

<p>Burgh drew his hand away&mdash;perhaps he was
afraid a shot would bring in others to see the fray.
But he dashed again at the young man. A short
struggle ensued, which ended in Burgh being thrown
again. Then Rupert, disinclined for a vulgar row,
walked away. He stopped at the door to give his
antagonist a bit of advice. "You touch me again,"
he said, "and I'll hand you over to the police after
giving you a good thrashing. It's what a bully like
you deserves. And if you dare to speak to Miss
Rayner I'll make Marport too hot to hold you."
When Rupert vanished, Burgh raised himself slowly
and with an evil smile. "Perhaps the place will be
too hot for you my fine gentleman," he said savagely,
and began to think.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rupert went to the ball-room and saw
that Olivia was dancing with Dr. Forge. Chris
Walker told him that Miss Wharf had gone on to
the balcony for the fresh air. Miss Pewsey was not to
be seen or Rupert would have told her to look after
her disreputable relative in the cloak-room. The
young man thought he would go up to the Major's
room and have a smoke, when he felt a light touch
on his shoulder. There stood Tung-yu.</p>

<p>"Excuse me sir," said the Chinaman in his excellent
English, "I am your friend. Major Tidman and
Dr. Forge are your enemies, and you have a third
enemy in that young man Burgh."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how do you know&mdash;" began Rupert.</p>

<p>Tung-yu bent forward and whispered. "I know
how your father died," he said softly and before
Rupert could detain him, he vanished.</p>

<p>But Ainsleigh waited but for a moment. The speech
was so surprising, that he determined to learn more.
At once he ran after the Chinaman but could not see
him. In spite of his noticeable clothes, he was
swallowed up in the crowd and Rupert plunged into
the gay throng determined to find the man who
could solve the mystery of Markham Ainsleigh's
death.</p>

<p>The night wore on and the fun became fast and
furious. Towards twelve the guests began to depart,
but many choice spirits declared they would keep
the ball rolling till dawn. One of these was Chris
Walker, who had imbibed more champagne than
was good for him. While he talked excitedly Miss
Pewsey came to him hastily. "Where is my dear
Sophia?" she asked, I can't find her, and with
her delicate health it is time she was home in
bed."</p>

<p>"I have not seen her. Have you, Dr. Forge?"</p>

<p>The lean doctor shook his head, "I have been in
the card room for the last hour," he said, "and
as Miss Wharf's doctor I assuredly say, she should
go home, there's midnight," and as he spoke the
strokes boomed from a tall clock in the hall.</p>

<p>"Clarence, have you seen her?" asked Miss
Pewsey of the buccaneer who had Olivia on his arm.</p>

<p>"No! I've just been waltzing with Miss
Rayner."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you Mr. Ainsleigh?"</p>

<p>"I have been smoking on the balcony," said
Rupert, who looked tired.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me," said Miss Pewsey wringing her
hands, "I wonder if dear Sophia has gone to see
Major Tidman. She is so kind-hearted and he is
ill&mdash;at least he says he is. Did he tell you
Clarence?"</p>

<p>"I saw him only for a minute and he went back
to his room I guess."</p>

<p>"Then Sophia must have gone there," cried Miss
Pewsey and hurried away. Olivia followed with
Forge as she thought also, that her aunt ought to go
home, and Clarence's attentions were becoming so
embarrassing that she feared there would be trouble
with Rupert. But soon, Miss Pewsey appeared
again and said that Miss Wharf was not in the
Major's room, nor was the Major there. Taking
Olivia and Clarence and Forge, she went to search
for the missing lady. Rupert lingered behind as he
did not wish to come into contact with the buccaneer.</p>

<p>The hunt proceeded for some time, and every
room in the hotel was searched. But Miss Wharf
could not be found. Finally everyone&mdash;for many of
the guests were hunting by this time&mdash;, went out
on the balcony. Miss Wharf was not there. "Oh,
dear me," cried Miss Pewsey, "wherever can
she be."</p>

<p>The balcony was searched from end to end.
Then one of the guests more venturesome, descended
the steps. He gave a cry of horror. "Bring
a light," he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Lights were brought and everyone rushed after
them. Half way down the steps lay Miss Wharf&mdash;dead&mdash;strangled,
and round her throat tightly
bound was a yellow and red silk tie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Mysterious Case</span></h4>


<p>The murder of Miss Sophia Wharf at the Bristol
Hotel ball made a great sensation. She had been
well-known in Marport, and her many friends were
enormously excited that each and everyone of them
had been acquainted with a person who had been&mdash;as
one of them put it&mdash;done to death. Also the
circumstances of the murder were most extraordinary.
It seemed almost incredible that a
popular lady should be murdered in so public a
place; though many said, that the safety of the
assassin lay in the very fact that he had chosen to
commit his crime a few yards away from a spot
where many people were congregated. But who
had killed Miss Wharf and why she was killed in so
brutal a manner, no one could understand.</p>

<p>When the local police heard of the assassination,
an Inspector with two subordinates took possession
of the hotel, and obtained from the manager a list
of the guests present at the ball. As these amounted
to something like two hundred, it seemed like looking
for a needle in a haystack to search for the criminal
amongst them. And many of them did not know
Miss Wharf even by sight, so it was certain that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
task of identifying the assassin would be one of
enormous difficulty. And the question was asked
on all hands. "What had taken the deceased lady
down the little-frequented steps?" The fan was
missing&mdash;Miss Pewsey noticed that, when she bent
over the dead, but the story of the fan was not yet
public property.</p>

<p>According to custom the local police communicated
with the Treasury, who placed the case in the hands
of the Criminal Investigation Department, and thus
it came about, that a plain clothes officer&mdash;in other
words a detective&mdash;was sent down to Marport. This
individual was called Rogers, and after paying a
visit to the Superintendent of the Marport Police
Office, he went to Ivy Lodge. Here, everything
was gloomy and silent. The body of the unfortunate
woman had been brought home, and was laid out
for burial. Dr. Forge, who with others had been on
the spot at the time of the discovery, examined the
corpse, and asserted that the miserable woman must
have been murdered just an hour, or half an hour
previous. As mid-night was chiming shortly before
the discovery of the crime, it can be safely declared&mdash;and
Dr. Forge did declare this&mdash;that Miss Wharf
was strangled between eleven and twelve. When
the corpse was found it was yet warm. Clarence
haunted the Lodge and talked with his aunt, but
Olivia kept to her own <ins title="roem">room</ins>.</p>

<p>"Tung-yu did it of course," said Mr. Burgh
decisively. "I reckon he came down to get that
fan, and grudged giving so much cash for it. I
surmise that he lured the old girl to those steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and then slipped the silk string round her neck."</p>

<p>"The silk tie," said Miss Pewsey whose eyes
were very black and glittering, though red round
the rims, from weeping.</p>

<p>"How do you know it's a tie?" asked Clarence
with a start.</p>

<p>"I know," replied his aunt tightening her thin
lips, "and I know to whom the tie belongs. But
you say that Tung-yu?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who else could have scragged the old girl aunt
Lavinia. The fan's gone&mdash;leastways I didn't see it
when we spotted the deader."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey nodded. "Yes, the fan is gone,"
she assented, "but if Tung-yu murdered dearest
Sophia, he can easily be arrested."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not," replied Mr. Burgh easily.
"Tung-yu's no slouch, you bet, and didn't intend to
lose his prize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The fan?" inquired Miss Pewsey.</p>

<p>"Just so, the fan," replied Clarence imperturbably,
"and he's on his way to China by this time."</p>

<p>"Clarence?" Miss Pewsey rose, much excited;
then calmed down. "I do not agree with you," said
she firmly. "Tung-yu is innocent."</p>

<p>"I'll lay a couple of dollars he isn't, Aunt Lavinia.
Do you remember that yacht I pointed out to you
last night. Well, t'was a steam deep-sea barky, two
hundred tons, Lloyd's measurement I reckon&mdash;quite
heavy enough to cut round the Cape into Chinese
waters. Well, she arrived in the afternoon yesterday
and after midnight she lighted out."</p>

<p>"But how do you know Tung-yu was on board?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I only size that up," said Clarence musingly.
"but it looks to me as though he'd engineered the
job. 'Twould be easy I guess for him to have had
a boat waiting for him. After he'd killed the old girl
and annexed the fan, he could dance down those steps
like a two year old and pick up the boat on the
beach. Course it's all my fancy," added Burgh
modestly, "but I guess I'm right."</p>

<p>"I guess you're not," snapped Miss Pewsey in
rather an unlady-like manner, and she rose to shake
out her skirts. "I know who killed dearest Sophia,"
she added, wagging a lean finger at her nephew.
"I know who possessed the tie, and I shall hand
that man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who the dickens is he anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Rupert Ainsleigh," replied Miss Pewsey with a
grim smile, and left the room, while the buccaneer
stared, and then smiled. It was pleasant to think
that his rival&mdash;as he considered Rupert,&mdash;should be
in such straits and should be pursued by the vindictive
hatred of Miss Pewsey, who would leave no stone
unturned to bring about the conviction of young
Ainsleigh.</p>

<p>"Well," said the buccaneer with his hands in his
pockets. "I guess I'm not taking a hand in this
biznai, and it ain't lively round these quarters. I'll git."</p>

<p>And this Mr. Burgh did. When he passed out of
the front door, he brushed against a plainly dressed
rubicund man with sharp grey eyes who glanced at
him inquisitively. However, the stranger said
nothing but proceeded to ring the bell. The maid-servant
who appeared took him into the drawing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>room
and carried a card to Miss Pewsey. The name
thereon was, Orlando Rodgers, C.I.D.</p>

<p>With this in her hand Miss Pewsey sailed into the
drawing-room and looked at the comfortable creature
who rose to greet her. "Mr. Orlando Rodgers,
C.I.D.?" queried the little old lady.</p>

<p>"Criminal Investigation Department," said the
man in a cool voice, and with a sharp glance at the
dry drab woman, "I'm in charge of the Wharf
Murder Case, and have been sent down by the
Treasury. As I have seen the Superintendent and
can learn nothing likely to throw light on the subject,
I have come to you&mdash;a relative?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Miss Pewsey sitting down, in a
rigid way. "I am the companion of the late Miss
Wharf. Her only relative, down here at all events,
is Miss Olivia Rayner."</p>

<p>"Can I see her?"</p>

<p>"I think not&mdash;at present. She is in her room
weeping. Though why she should display such
grief I can't understand," added Miss Pewsey spitefully.</p>

<p>"It's natural in a relative, miss," said the detective
looking hard at the withered little face.</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey laughed in a shrill manner, and
spoke between her teeth more than ever, emphasising
every word as usual. "Oh, dear me, no," said she.
"Miss Wharf and Olivia never got on well. The
girl hated her aunt, though dearest Sophia&mdash;Miss
Wharf, you know, sir&mdash;brought her up, when she
hadn't a shilling or a friend in the world."</p>

<p>"To whom have I the honour of speaking?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
asked Rodgers wondering how much of this spiteful
speech was true, and seeing plainly enough that the
speaker was no friend to the niece.</p>

<p>"I am Lavinia Pewsey," said that lady, "and for
years I have been the cherished friend and dearest
companion of Sophia. We were at school together,
and were&mdash;as I may say&mdash;like two cherries on one
stalk. Anything I can do to avenge her death will
be done."</p>

<p>"Punishment by the law, doesn't come under the
head of vengeance!"</p>

<p>"It comes under the head of hanging, and I'll be
glad to see the rope round his neck."</p>

<p>"Of whom are you talking?" asked Rodgers
phlegmatically.</p>

<p>"Of the man who killed my dearest friend."</p>

<p>"Oh. I understood from the Superintendent
that the affair was quite a mystery."</p>

<p>"Not to me," snapped Miss Pewsey, "Rupert
Ainsleigh strangled her to get the fan."</p>

<p>"What fan?" asked the detective taking out his
note-book, "and who is Rupert Ainsleigh?"</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey spread her skirts and folded her
hands together in a prim way. "I shall tell you
all," she cried, "and please take down all I say. I
am prepared to make this statement in a law court."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rodgers moistening his pencil, "you
may have to. Now this Mr. Ainsleigh?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of Royabay, a few miles from Marport," said
Miss Pewsey, "quite one of the old families. A
nice come down for the Ainsleighs, for the last of
them to die on the gallows."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is not there yet," said Rodgers dryly, "and
may I ask you to speak in a more reasonable way.
I see you don't like the man."</p>

<p>"I hate him," Miss Pewsey drew a long breath,
"and I hated his father before him, to say nothing
of his mother, who was a cat."</p>

<p>"Then your evidence is prejudiced, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Mr. Orlando Rodgers," she
replied sharply, "take down what I say, and then
you can sift the matter out for yourself. My Sophia
was murdered to obtain possession of a fan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What fan?" asked Rodgers again.</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey smiled, and calmly detailed all she
had learned from Dr. Forge concerning the fan.
"You can ask my nephew, Clarence Burgh, about
these things also," she ended, "and Dr. Forge, and
Mr. Christopher Walker, who brought the Chinaman
Tung-yu to the ball, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," interrupted the detective, "it
appears to me from what you say," he ran a quick
eye over his notes, "that the suspicion points to
these Chinamen you mention. They advertised, and
they wanted the fan. Now Hwei&mdash;as I hear from
you&mdash;was not at the ball, but Tung-yu was. Therefore
Tung-yu&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't do it," said the little woman. "I don't
pretend to understand why Hwei offered death and
Tung-yu money for the possession of the fan; nor
do I know why this Mandarin, whatever his name
may be, is so anxious to get possession of the article.
But I know that the fan is gone and that Tung-yu,
who did not intend murder, hasn't got it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then who has?"</p>

<p>"Rupert Ainsleigh. He went up about the
advertisement and knew all about the fan. I believe
he killed my Sophia, and got the fan, so as to sell it
for five thousand to Tung-yu&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But a gentleman of property wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A gentleman of property," snorted the old maid
smoothing her dress, "why he's head over ears in
debt and will lose Royabay before the end of the
year on account of the fore-closure of a mortgage.
He'd have done anything to get money, and five
thousand pounds is not a small amount."</p>

<p>"This is all very well: but I don't see how you
connected Mr. Ainsleigh with the crime."</p>

<p>"By means of the silk necktie," said Miss Pewsey
with a triumphant smile, and related how Rupert
had received the scarf from Olivia, "if he is guiltless
how came his silk tie round the throat of
Sophia?"</p>

<p>Rodgers was shaken by this piece of evidence. "It
looks queer I admit," he said: then added, "I
understand that Mr. Ainsleigh is an admirer of Miss
Rayner."</p>

<p>"He wants to marry her, and she is in love with
him," said Miss Pewsey, "which is an additional
reason for the crime."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You're not a sharp man," said the old woman
tranquilly, "don't you see that as Miss Rayner inherits
dearest Sophia's money, she will get the mortgage
also. Then with that, and the five thousand pounds
Mr. Ainsleigh would be free from his money-troubles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Well," she added sharply, as the detective rose,
"what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present. Give me the address of
Dr. Forge who, I believe, examined the body, and of
your nephew and Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey did this with alacrity and accompanied
Rodgers to the door. "Don't spare
him," she said venomously, "he's guilty and he shall
hang," and she shut the door herself.</p>

<p>"What a spiteful woman," mused Rodgers, leaving
Ivy Lodge, "her story is so very explicit that I am
inclined to doubt it. She wants this young man
scragged. Why?"</p>

<p>He could find no answer to this question, but
went on his way to see Clarence Burgh. His interview
with the buccaneer was brief, Clarence related
the story of the yacht, and set forth his theory of
Tung-yu. "Mind," said he, "I don't like Ainsleigh,
as he's trying to run the girl I want to hitch longside
of. But I guess he didn't scragg the old girl."</p>

<p>"You speak fairer than your aunt," said Rodgers
dryly.</p>

<p>Clarence heaved up his right shoulder. "Huh,"
said he, "if you go by woman's jaw, you'll get on
the shoals. Tung-yu scragged the old girl, you bet,
and he's on his way to China in that yacht."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see if we can't stop the yacht. She
must coal somewhere. What is her name?"</p>

<p>"The Stormy Petrel," said Clarence, "I got that
out of a boatman, who was rowing about her
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Did he see any Chinaman on board?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. He didn't see anyone. There didn't
appear to be anyone about, or else they were at tea,"
concluded Clarence ungrammatically.</p>

<p>"Humph," said the detective, noting the name of
the yacht, "do you know anything of the silk tie?"</p>

<p>"No. Aunt Lavinia says it belongs to Ainsleigh,
but I never saw it till it was round the throat of the
old girl. I should like to think he put it there,"
said Clarence pleasantly, "for I want that chap out
of the way; but I believe Tung-yu's the man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is. Have you a copy of that
advertisement?"</p>

<p>"No. But I reckon Ainsleigh has. Ain't you
going to see him?"</p>

<p>Rogers nodded. "Straight away. And I thank
you for what you have told me. You want him
hanged I presume."</p>

<p>"Well no I reckon not. He's in my way, but I
can lay him out on my own, without the lynching
biznai."</p>

<p>"You are fairer than your aunt," said the detective
once more.</p>

<p>"Go slow. She's only an acid-drop, and you
can't size her up, just as an ordinary girl. She was
crazy on Markham, the father of this young
Ainsleigh, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And proposes to hang the son to avenge herself
on his father. A nice woman, truly. But it seems
to me Mr. Burgh that if anyone killed Miss Wharf,
Hwei is the man."</p>

<p>"Might be. He wasn't at the ball anyhow.
Tung-yu was."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Tung-yu&mdash;as I understand from Miss
Pewsey&mdash;intended to call the next day&mdash;to-day that
is&mdash;and buy the fan for five thousand."</p>

<p>"Huh," Clarence heaved up his shoulder again,
"perhaps he thought he'd settle in another way.
'Day. I'll be along here whenever you like to call.
I wish to see this biznai through, you bet."</p>

<p>Rodgers departed, and sought out Rupert at
Royabay. The young man was walking up and
down the terrace smoking furiously. At the sight
of the stranger he frowned and Rodgers noted that
he looked worn and ill. "Might be money worries,"
thought the detective, "and it might be the other
thing."</p>

<p>However, he kept these thoughts to himself and
merely detailed what he had learned from Miss
Pewsey and set forth the accusation she brought
against him. Ainsleigh heard the detective quietly
enough, and smiled wearily when the explanation
was concluded. "Miss Pewsey doesn't love me,"
he said quietly, "and would like to see me out of
the way, so that Miss Rayner could marry her
nephew."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Rodgers, "Miss Rayner will
have the dead lady's money, and the nephew is
poor."</p>

<p>"I really don't know," replied Rupert coldly,
"Mr. Burgh is a mystery to me. He comes from
nowhere, though I believe he has been in China."</p>

<p>"And knows what about the fan?"</p>

<p>"I think so. At all events, young Walker declares
that Burgh was talking to a Chinaman near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Mansion House. Burgh admits this, and also
admits that the Chinaman was Hwei, who put in
that advertisement.</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to suspect Hwei himself," said
Rodgers looking keenly at the worn face of the
young man, "but this silk tie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is mine, Mr. Rodgers. Miss Rayner gave it
to me last night."</p>

<p>"So Miss Pewsey says&mdash;on the balcony."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Miss Pewsey was spying and saw
the tie given. As the colours are rather pronounced,
she could easily identify it. I took it to the cloak-room
and placed it in the pocket of my overcoat."</p>

<p>"And took it out again?"</p>

<p>"No." Rupert rose and grew crimson, "surely
you are not so unjust as to believe Miss Pewsey's
malignant tale."</p>

<p>"You may be sure, Mr. Ainsleigh, that I'll act
fairly towards you," said the detective dryly, "but
the tie having been used to strangle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know how it came round her throat,"
interrupted Ainsleigh imperiously, "I placed the tie
in my overcoat pocket&mdash;that was the last I saw of it,
until I noticed it on Miss Wharf's dead body."</p>

<p>"Did anyone else see the tie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Major Tidman."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A retired Army man&mdash;South American Army&mdash;who
stops at Bristol Hotel. He is much respected
here. I went to the cloak-room, and found him
talking to Tung-yu. Both saw me place the tie in
my coat."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodgers sat up. "Oh," said he opening his eyes
widely, "then Tung-yu saw you place the tie in the
coat."</p>

<p>"He did, but if you suspect he took it out again,
I think you are wrong. He left the room and I
exchanged a few words with Major Tidman."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"About this fan. Major Tidman told me to leave
it alone. But of course I never intended to meddle
with it. Miss Wharf had it, and she hated me too
much to let me handle it, though she did give me
the chance of making the money," said Rupert, with
an after thought.</p>

<p>"Eh, how was that?"</p>

<p>"She offered to let me have the fan if I gave up
my claim to Miss Rayner, whom she desired should
marry Mr. Burgh, I refused."</p>

<p>"Humph," said Rodgers again, "and how does
Major Tidman come to know about the fan?"</p>

<p>"I refer you to him for an answer."</p>

<p>"And how did he come to know Tung-yu?"</p>

<p>"I believe he met him in Canton," replied Rupert
restlessly, "he had some adventure there&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Connected with this <ins title="ubiquitious">ubiquitous</ins> fan?" asked
Rodgers sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes. He promised to tell me the adventure to-day,
but I had not seen him yet."</p>

<p>"Humph. He may come after all. I'll call on
this gentleman. At the Bristol you say. Quite
so," Rodgers took a note. "Now then Mr. Ainsleigh,
tell me how you came to go up about the advertisement?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert related his father's dealings with Lo-Keong,
and referred to the secret said to be connected
with the fan. The detective heard him in
silence, and appeared to be struck by his frankness.
"I think it's one of the most complicated cases I
ever had to do with, Mr. Ainsleigh, and will take a
lot of searching into."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't suspect me?"</p>

<p>"Humph, the tie is, strangely enough, the rope
used to strangle this woman, and you admit that it
is yours. But Tung-yu saw you put it in your overcoat
pocket, and he wanted the fan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For five thousand pounds remember. Hwei
was the one who threatened to gain the fan, by
killing."</p>

<p>"Don't defend Tung-yu too much," said the detective
dryly, "your position is not a pleasant one and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to arrest me?" asked Rupert
rising angrily.</p>

<p>"Not at present. But no doubt at the inquest
you can prove an alibi."</p>

<p>Rupert turned away, "I can't," he said in a low
voice, "I was walking outside smoking between
eleven and twelve&mdash;on the beach."</p>

<p>"That's a pity, Mr. Ainsleigh, I may have to arrest
you after all. But who is this gentleman. Major
Tidman!&mdash;quite so, Good-day Major."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Canton Adventure</span></h4>


<p>Major Tidman who was standing at the foot of
the terrace stared at the man before him. "How
do you know my name?" he asked, and looked
towards Rupert for a reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Rodgers produced a red silk handkerchief and
wiped his face for it was noon and very warm. "A
guess on my part," he answered, "Mr. Ainsleigh
said you might come here, to tell him of your Canton
adventure, and I fancied it might be you, Major
Tidman."</p>

<p>"I am not aware," said the Major loftily, "why
you should interest yourself in my private affairs."</p>

<p>"I interest myself in everybodys private affairs,
when they have to do with murder," said Rodgers
quietly.</p>

<p>Tidman stared and gasped. "Then you are?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The detective in charge of the Wharf murder
case. I am glad to see you, sir," he laid a finger on
Tidman's chest, "you have something to tell me no
doubt?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Major gasping again, "I have
not."</p>

<p>Rupert looked at him suddenly and the Major's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
small eyes fell before that direct gaze. "Let us go,
into the library," said Ainsleigh tranquilly, "we may
as well have a long talk before I am arrested."</p>

<p>Tidman jumped. "Arrested," he cried staring.</p>

<p>Something in his looks, made Rodgers take the
cue thus offered, "I may have to arrest Mr. Ainsleigh
for the murder," he said significantly.</p>

<p>"But that's rubbish, why should he murder Miss
Wharf?"</p>

<p>"On account of the fan," put in Rupert grimly.</p>

<p>"I'll never believe that&mdash;never," said Tidman
vigorously.</p>

<p>Rodgers looked at him sideways. "Well you see,"
said he in a cheerful voice. "Miss Wharf was
strangled with a red and yellow silk tie, belonging
to Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"I know, and I saw him place that tie in his overcoat
pocket."</p>

<p>"You say that. Quite so. Mr. Ainsleigh might
have taken it out again."</p>

<p>"No. He couldn't have done that. The attendant
came back, and remained in the room all the
rest of the evening."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because I returned to the cloak-room to see if
Mr. Ainsleigh was there. I learned from the
attendant," said the Major volubly, "that Mr.
Ainsleigh and Mr Burgh had been fighting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the detective, "so Mr. Burgh knew of
the tie also?"</p>

<p>"He did not," put in young Ainsleigh rapidly,
"he came in, after I put the tie away. He insulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
me, about&mdash;about a lady," said Rupert hesitating,
"and I knocked him down twice."</p>

<p>"Didn't the attendant interfere?"</p>

<p>"No. Burgh threw him a shilling and told him
to cut. I ordered the man to stay, but he obeyed
Burgh. Then we had a row, and I went away."</p>

<p>"Leaving Mr. Burgh in the cloak-room?" asked
Rodgers shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Yes. But he knew nothing about the tie. He
could not have taken it. I am sure he didn't."</p>

<p>The detective smiled in a puzzled manner.
"Upon my word Mr. Ainsleigh, you defend everyone.
First Tung-yu, now Mr. Burgh, who is your
enemy."</p>

<p>"I have so many enemies," said Rupert with a
shrug, "Tung-yu told me that Burgh and Forge
and Major Tidman were my enemies."</p>

<p>"That's a lie on Tung-yu's part," chimed in the
Major angrily. "I am not your enemy."</p>

<p>Rupert turned on him quickly. "Prove it then,"
he said, sharply, "by stating that I was with you
on the beach last night after eleven."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," cried Rodgers smiling, "so you can
prove an alibi after all, Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rupert shortly. "But I did not wish
to speak, until I heard what Major Tidman had to say."</p>

<p>Rodgers shook his head. "You have too nice a
sense of honour," was his remark, "or else you are
very deep."</p>

<p>Rupert did not reply. His eyes were fixed on the
Major's face, which changed to various colours.
"You knew my father well Tidman?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. We were old friends&mdash;good friends,"
faltered the other.</p>

<p>"Do you know how he died?"</p>

<p>"No I do not." The Major wiped his face, "I
can safely say I do not."</p>

<p>"But you know he was murdered."</p>

<p>The Major started. "Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Tung-yu, and you know Tung-yu, who might
have explained the circumstances of my father's
death to you."</p>

<p>"He did not," said Tidman earnestly, "but I
heard that Mr. Ainsleigh did die by violence. I
don't know under what circumstances."</p>

<p>"This is all very well gentlemen," said the
detective, "but it does not help me."</p>

<p>"It may help you, Mr. Rodgers. The murder of
Miss Wharf is connected with this fan, and the
Major can tell you about his Canton adventure
which has to do with it also."</p>

<p>Major Tidman turned grey and his face looked
fearful, "I came to tell you, Rupert," he said trying
to be calm, "but it won't help this man," he nodded
towards Rodgers, "to find the assassin."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," replied Rodgers briskly,
"let us go in and sit down. The fan is at the
bottom of this business, and when I learn all about
it, I may know how to act."</p>

<p>The Major shrugged his plump shoulders and
walked towards the open French window. When
he passed through to the library, the detective
and Ainsleigh followed. In a few minutes, they
were comfortably seated. Rupert asked the two if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
they would have some refreshments, and receiving a
reply in the affirmative, rang the bell. "Though
mind you, Mr. Ainsleigh," said Rodgers, "this
drinking a glass of wine doesn't stop me from arresting
you, if I see fit."</p>

<p>"You can set your mind at rest," said Rupert
coldly, "I have no wish to tie you down to a bread
and salt treaty. Some wine, Mrs. Petley."</p>

<p>The housekeeper, who had entered, was as plump
as ever, but her face looked yellow, and old, and
haggard, and there was a terrified look in her eyes.
In strange contrast to her usual volubility, she did
not speak a word, but dropping a curtsey, went out.</p>

<p>"That woman looks scared," said the detective.</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> scared," assented Rupert, "we have a
ghost here, Mr. Rodgers&mdash;the ghost of a monk, and
Mrs. Petley thought she saw it last night."</p>

<p>"Really," said the detective with good-humoured
contempt, "she <i>thought</i> she saw a ghost. What
nonsense."</p>

<p>"No, sir. It ain't nonsense."</p>

<p>It was the housekeeper who spoke. Having seen
the Major coming up the avenue, she knew that he
would require his usual glass of port, and therefore
had prepared the tray, while the conversation was
taking place on the terrace. This accounted for her
quick return, and she set down the tray with the
jingling glasses and decanter as she spoke. "It
was a ghost, sure enough," said Mrs. Petley, when
the small table was placed before the three gentlemen,
"the ghost of Abbot Raoul. I've seen him
times and again, but never so plainly as last night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
It was between eleven and twelve," added Mrs.
Petley without waiting for permission to speak,
"and I sat up for Master Rupert here. I took a
walk outside, it being fine and dry, and like a fool,
I went in to the abbey."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you go there?" asked Rodgers.</p>

<p>"Because Abbot Raoul always walks where he
was burnt," replied Mrs. Petley, "and there he was
sure enough. No moonlight could I see, but the
stars gave a faint light, and he was near the square&mdash;the
accursed square where they burnt the poor
soul. I gave one screech as he swept past in his
long robes and a cowl, and when I come to myself
on the damp grass, he was gone. I hurried in and
told Petley, who came out and searched, but bless
you," went on the housekeeper with contempt, "he
couldn't find a thing that had gone back to the
other world&mdash;not he."</p>

<p>"It was a dream, Mrs. Petley," said Rupert
soothingly.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Trouble is coming to the Ainsleighs,
as always does when the Abbot walks. And this
morning I went out and found this," and Mrs. Petley,
fishing in her capacious pocket, produced a small
stick which smelt like cinnamon. Round it was a
roll of scarlet paper inscribed with queer characters.
Rupert stretched out his hand to take it, but the
detective anticipated him.</p>

<p>"It's a joss-stick," said Rodgers. "I've seen
them in the Whitechapel opium dens. Humph!
Why should the ghost of an old monk use a joss-stick,
like the Chinese?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Before anyone could reply, Mrs. Petley gave a
cry, "I told you trouble was coming, Master Rupert,
dear," she said with the tears streaming from her
fat face, "and anything to do with that weary
Chiner where your poor pa lost his life always do
bring trouble. Oh, dear me," she put her silk apron
to her eyes and walked slowly out of the room. "I
must tell my John. He may be able to say what's
coming, as he have a gift of prophecy, that he have."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Petley closed the door after her, the
three men looked at one another. "Do you believe
in this ghost, Mr. Ainsleigh?" asked the detective,
examining the joss-stick.</p>

<p>Rupert did not give a direct answer. "I don't
know what to believe, Mr. Rodgers. Our family
traditions have always pointed to the walking <ins title="of of">of</ins>
Abbot Raoul before trouble, and it might be so.
I have never seen the ghost myself, though."</p>

<p>"Your ghost is a Chinaman," said the detective,
tapping the stick.</p>

<p>"But what would a Chinaman be doing in the
cloisters?"</p>

<p>"Ah. That's what we've got to find out. There
was a yacht in Marport Harbour last night, which
came at midday, and departed in a hurry after midnight.
Burgh says he believes Tung-yu went away
in her, after committing the murder."</p>

<p>"Even if he did," said Rupert, calmly, "that
does not show how the joss-stick came here, or why
a Chinaman should be masquerading as a monk, for
that, I take it, is your meaning."</p>

<p>"It is. I believe there were other Chinamen on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
board that boat," was the detective's reply. "Perhaps
this man Hwei came to the Abbey."</p>

<p>"He might have come," said Ainsleigh, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Or Tung-yu," went on Rodgers.</p>

<p>"No," said the Major who had kept silent all this
time, but had observed everything, "it was not
Tung-yu's day."</p>

<p>Rodgers turned on him. "What do you mean
by that?"</p>

<p>The Major settled himself more comfortably in his
chair. "I'll tell you my adventure at Canton first,"
he said, "and then you may understand. I can't
get to the bottom of the matter myself, for why Lo-Keong
should have a private god of good luck is
more than I can tell."</p>

<p>The others looked at him, amazed at this queer
speech. "What is this private god?" asked the
detective.</p>

<p>"I don't know, save that it is called Kwang-ho."</p>

<p>Rupert started. "That was the god mentioned
in the advertisement."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it was," replied the Major, quietly, "but
just you wait and hear my story. It may lead to
something being discovered."</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Ainsleigh. Show me the
advertisement."</p>

<p>Rupert rose, and going to the writing-desk took
therefrom the slip he had cut from the paper.
Rodgers read it, quietly. "I see. Here is mentioned
the doom of the god, Kwang-ho."</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong's private god of good luck," said the
Major.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are there private as well as public gods in
China?"</p>

<p>Tidman looked perplexed. "I can't say. I know
nothing. Wait and hear what I can tell," he
settled himself again and began to speak rapidly.
"I was in Canton seven years ago," said he, "I had
made my money here, and didn't intend to travel
again. But Miss Wharf persuaded me to go to
China, to see if I could find out why Markham
Ainsleigh had been killed."</p>

<p>Rupert looked astonished. "Why? she hated my
father."</p>

<p>"She loved him first and hated him later," said
Tidman, quietly, "a fine woman was poor Miss
Wharf. I was in love with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never knew that Tidman."</p>

<p>"I was though," said the Major, "and Miss Pewsey
hated me for being in love with her. I spoke badly
of Miss Wharf to you Ainsleigh because I was
angered with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You called her a mass of granite."</p>

<p>"And so she is," said the Major angrily, "she
promised to marry me if I went to China and learned
how your father came by his death. I did go, but I
came back without learning more, than that he was
murdered, so Miss Wharf refused to keep her
promise. I believe it was that Pewsey cat's fault."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;go on," said Rodgers looking at his
watch, "all this business is very round-about. I
want to get on with my work."</p>

<p>"This may have to do with it," said the Major
smartly. "Well, I was in Canton, and intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
go up to the Kan-su province to make enquiries. I
met Forge in Canton. He had just come from Pekin,
and showed me round. He laughed at the idea that
Markham had died by violence, and said it was
dysentery."</p>

<p>"So he always said," murmured Rupert, who
listened intently.</p>

<p>"And told a lie," retorted Tidman, "however I
believed him, but all the same I intended to make
enquiries at the mine of the Hwei River in the Kan-su
province. But I stopped in Canton with Forge
for a time, as he said he would go up with me. In
some way, the fact of my trying to learn the truth
about Markham's death got about."</p>

<p>"No doubt Forge told it to others," suggested
Rupert.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never got to the bottom of the
business. But one day a half-starved Chinaman
stopped me in the street, and told me he could explain,
if I came with him. I went to a miserable
house in a low part of the city. The man closed the
door, and then drew a fan from his breast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The fan in question?" asked Rodgers making a
note.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the very article. He told me that this fan
would reveal the truth, and offered it to me."</p>

<p>"For money?"</p>

<p>"No. He refused to take a penny. He seemed
anxious to get rid of the fan, and kept looking round
everywhere as though he thought someone might be
listening. I asked him how the fan could tell about
the death, but all he said, was, that it could."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"But in what way?" asked Ainsleigh, puzzled.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," said the Major, with an air
of fatigue. "I am telling you all I know. I took
the fan and cleared, and got home safely enough.
Then I hid away the fan&mdash;where it doesn't matter;
but I have travelled so much that I always keep a
secret place for money and valuables. I placed the
fan there, though I really didn't know what to make
of the matter. After a few days I came to my rooms
to find that everything had been ripped open and
smashed and searched&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the fan was gone," said Rodgers.</p>

<p>"Not it. They&mdash;whosoever they were who
searched, could not find my hiding place. Well, a
day or two later, as I was walking along the street at
night, I was seized up and gagged, and carried to
some low Chinese house. There a Chinaman examined
me, and asked me what I had done with the
fan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What sort of a man was he?" asked Rupert,
"would you know him again?"</p>

<p>The Major looked doubtful. "Chinamen are all
so alike," he said, "but this chap had only one eye,
and was a villainous looking beast. He declared that
he knew the first Celestial had given me the fan, and
that he wanted it. I refused to give it up. He took
out a knife, and said he would slice me up. Oh,"
broke off the Major looking grey and old, "however
shall I forget that terrible moment, Ainsleigh. Do
you wonder that I shudder to relate this adventure,
and that I refuse to speak of it. I was in that
miserable place, in the midst of a horde of Chinamen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
bound and helpless, with a knife at my throat. I
never did care for death," said Tidman boldly, "but
to be cut slowly into slices, was more than I could
stand."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you give up the fan then?" asked
Rodgers.</p>

<p>"Because I made up my mind that slicing or no
slicing, I wasn't going to be bullied by a lot of heathen
devils. The position was awful, but I'm an Englishman,
and I resolved to hold off to the last moment,
I dare say I would have given up the fan after all, as
the one-eyed brute began to cut me up. I lost a big
toe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Rupert, while Rodgers shook his head,
"did this man cut a toe off?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;my big toe. I was about to give in, when
suddenly a small Chinese boy dressed in red&mdash;queerly
enough, as the Chinese don't go in much for
that colour&mdash;appeared and said something. The
one-eyed Chinaman scowled, and put his knife away.
Then he cleared out with the boy and his other
friends and I was left alone. Then with the loss of
blood, and the pain of my toe I fainted."</p>

<p>"No wonder," said Ainsleigh, "I don't blame
you. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, then I came to my senses in my own
room. Forge was with me and said that he had
traced me to the hovel and had rescued me with the
aid of the Canton police. He declared that I would
have to leave Canton at once, or this one-eyed
Chinaman would be after me. I agreed, and with
Forge I went that very day on board a homeward-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>bound
steamer. I thanked Forge for having helped
me, and he asked if I would give him the fan as a reward.
I refused, as I wanted to know how it could
tell about Markham's death. Forge said that if I
kept possession of the fan, the one-eyed Chinaman
would track me to England and kill me. But I held
out, till I got to Marport. Then I grew weary of
Forge worrying me, particularly as he promised to do
what he could to learn the secret of the fan, and
help me to marry Miss Wharf. So he took the fan,
and then, as you know, Ainsleigh, he took it out to
China again, where it fell into the hands of a pirate
from whom Clarence Burgh received it."</p>

<p>"But how did it get from Dr. Forge's hands into
those of the pirate?" asked Rodgers curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know; you can ask Forge. He lives
here."</p>

<p>The detective took a note of the doctor's address.
"That's all right," he said, "there's no doubt the
poor lady was killed to procure this fan. Did you
tell her of your adventure?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Major with a shudder. "I merely
said that I could not learn how Markham was killed
and she refused to marry me. I did not care about
speaking of the adventure. You know how the fan
came into Miss Wharf's possession Mr. Rodgers?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the detective nodded, "Mr. Burgh told
me, but I'll have another talk with him. Humph.
It seems to me that one of these Chinamen killed
Miss Wharf, and that the tie was used to lay the
blame on Mr. Ainsleigh here."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ainsleigh drawing a breath, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
glad to hear that you don't suspect me, but I can't
think that Tung-yu stole the tie, even though he did
see me place it in the coat."</p>

<p>"I'll look after that cloak-room attendant," said
Rodgers, making another note, "and he'll have to
give an account of himself. But I don't see what
this private god Kwang-ho has to do with the
matter."</p>

<p>"I can only tell you this," said Major Tidman,
"I had a cold last night and stopped in my room.
But I heard that Tung-yu was down the stairs, and,
as I knew him in Canton, I went to have a look for
him. He was a pleasant companion in Canton."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him about the fan and your
adventure?"</p>

<p>"No, Ainsleigh, and I was annoyed that you
should have let slip that I had such an adventure.
I don't want to be mixed up in the matter. Tung-yu
is nice enough, but if he has to do with the fan he is
quite capable of turning nasty and making things
unpleasant for me. But I mentioned about his advertisement,
and how I came to know of it through
you. He confessed that Lo-Keong had lost the fan
and wished it back again, as it had to do with some
family business. The finding of it was referred to
the god Kwang-ho, and the priest of the god, said
that two men were to search for the fan."</p>

<p>"Hwei and Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"Yes. They were to search on alternate days.
If Hwei found it he was to kill the person from
whom he got it. If it was Tung-yu's day he was to
give the fortunate person five thousand pounds."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"And whose day was it on the night of the
crime?"</p>

<p>"Hwei's," said the Major, "that was why Tung-yu
could not buy the fan when Miss Wharf offered
it to him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">At the Inquest</span></h4>


<p>When Mr. Orlando Rodgers of the C.I.D. rolled
into the Superintendent's office the next day to relate
what he had heard, he was not so glib as usual.
After sleeping on the extraordinary tale he had heard
from Major Tidman, and considering the fragments
imparted by Clarence Burgh, and young Ainsleigh,
he came to look on the matter as something to do
with the Arabian Nights. The fan which the
deceased lady had carried at the ball was certainly
gone, and the whole of these marvellous matters
connected with China, hung on the fan. But Miss
Wharf may have been murdered for some other
reason, and Rodgers was half inclined, when looking
into the case in the cold searching morning light, to
abandon the fan theory. But he delayed doing this
until he had consulted with Superintendant Young,
who looked after the Marport police.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" he asked, when his
tale was told. The Superintendent was a tall thin
man with a cold eye and a distrustful manner.
He believed only half he saw, and absolutely nothing
he heard. Consequently when Rodgers ended, and
his opinion was asked, he sniffed disdainfully, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
put on his most official expression. "It's a fairy
tale," said Young in his dry voice, which was like
the creaking of a rusty wheel.</p>

<p>"Well now, the woman was murdered."</p>

<p>"But not for this fan, Mr. Rodgers."</p>

<p>"Then what motive do you think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I don't undertake to say, sir. Let us gather all
the evidence we can and submit it to an intelligent
jury at the inquest. It takes place to-day at
the public house near the corner of the Cliff Road
and not far from Ivy Lodge. When the jury has
inspected the body, it will sit with the Coroner at
the Bull's Head."</p>

<p>"A Chinaman calling himself Tung-yu was at the
ball you know," said Rodgers, unwilling to abandon
the theory in spite of his doubts.</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. Mr. Christopher Walker brought
him down, and I went to see that young gentleman
before he departed for business this morning. He
told me that Tung-yu was a clerk in the same firm
of tea merchants as he was employed with, and had
not been at the office since he left to come to the
ball. Mr. Walker last saw Tung-yu at the door of
the hotel, looking out across the pier."</p>

<p>"Well," said Young drily.</p>

<p>"That yacht was there," went on Rodgers, "and
showed a green light so it's just possible that Mr.
Burgh may be right and that the Chinaman did
steam away in her."</p>

<p>"Well then, search for the yacht."</p>

<p>"I intend to, and when I find her&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Tung-yu will have an explanation. No, Mr.
Rodgers," said the Superintendent rising, "I can't
believe all this business is about a trifle such as this
fan. Some more serious motive is at the bottom
of this murder. Now Mr. Ainsleigh's tie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can explain that," said the detective, and he
did.</p>

<p>Young listened disbelievingly. "So he says," was
his comment.</p>

<p>"But I don't think Mr. Ainsleigh is the sort of
man to commit a brutal crime like this, and in so
public a place."</p>

<p>"Everyone's capable of committing a crime if
there's anything to be gained," was the Superintendent's
philosophy, "and Mr. Ainsleigh's very
agreeable manner with which you appear to be
struck, may be a mask to hide an evil nature."</p>

<p>"Oh rubbish; begging your pardon Mr. Young.
Look at this joss-stick," and Rodgers held it out,
"that was found in the ruins of Royabay Abbey, so
you see some Chinaman must be mixed up in the
job. I am beginning to believe that the tale may
be true after all."</p>

<p>"It's too wild&mdash;too far-fetched. I can't believe
it."</p>

<p>"Because you haven't imagination."</p>

<p>"We don't want imagination in this matter, Mr.
Rodgers. Facts sir."</p>

<p>Rodgers got up and put on his hat. "Well, we'll
not be able to agree, I can see that," said he, "and
as the case is in my hands, I am going away to
look after evidence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not arrest Mr. Ainsleigh?"</p>

<p>"Because the evidence against him is not sufficiently
strong," the detective sat down again. "See
here Mr. Superintendent, if I so chose I could
manufacture a case against three of these people at
least, and give it to them pretty strong too. Supposing,
for the sake of theorising mind, we say
Mr. Ainsleigh killed the woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which I am inclined to think he did, on the
tie's evidence."</p>

<p>"Very good, I can show you how strong you can
make the case against him, Mr. Young. This young
man was at the ball, he hated the deceased and she
hated him on account of the difficulty of the
marriage with Miss Rayner. Ainsleigh wants money
badly, and might have killed the old woman to get
the fan and sell it for five thousand pounds. Also
by marrying Miss Rayner who will inherit Miss
Wharf's money, he gets rid of a mortgage that's
troubling him. What was easier for him, than to
pretend to put the silk scarf in his coat pocket, so
as to blind those who saw him do it, and then to
lure Miss Wharf out on to those steps and scrag
her. Then he could pass the fan to Tung-yu who
wanted it, and arrange about the money being paid.
After that and when Tung-yu had gone off to the
yacht, Mr. Ainsleigh could slip back into the ballroom
and assist in finding the body. And remember,
he says, he was strolling on the beach smoking,
between the hours of eleven and twelve, and won't
prove an alibi, though between ourselves I think he
can through Major Tidman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Young dryly, "doesn't this go to
prove his guilt."</p>

<p>"I can prove Tung-yu's in the same way," said
Rodger's coolly, "he was in the cloak-room when
Mr. Ainsleigh placed the scarf in the coat. He
could easily have stolen it, as these Chinamen are
clever thieves, and have then lured Miss Wharf on
to the steps under the pretence of treating about
the fan. Suddenly he slips the scarf round her
throat before she can cry out, goes down the steps
and on to the beach where a boat is waiting for him,
and by now, may be on his way to his employer the
Mandarin Lo-Keong."</p>

<p>"It sounds feasible I admit, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," went on Rodgers eagerly, "quite
as strong a case can be made out against Major
Tidman. He did not come to the ball, but lurked
in his room all the evening. Yet he came down to
see Tung-yu&mdash;what about?&mdash;to sell the fan of
course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't prove that."</p>

<p>"Am I proving anything? I am simply showing
you what strong cases can be built up out of nothing.
Well then, Tidman sees the scarf put in the coat by
a young man, whom he knows is at enmity with the
deceased, and takes it out again. He gets Miss
Wharf to come on to the terrace&mdash;any pretext will
do, as he is her lover and her old friend. There, he
strangles her on the steps and taking the fan, passes
it along to the Chinaman who makes for the yacht.
So you see if I chose I can build up a case against
each of these three gentlemen, and each equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
strong. Why if I had a mind to entangle young
Mr. Burgh in the affair I could do so."</p>

<p>"But Tung-yu, Mr. Burgh and Major Tidman
might prove alibi's."</p>

<p>"So they might, and Mr. Ainsleigh might do so also."</p>

<p>"He has not done so yet and if he was in danger,
he would."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Rodgers quickly, and seeing the
slip, "and his very reluctance to prove an alibi&mdash;for
surely someone besides Tidman must have seen
him on the beach&mdash;shows me he is innocent. However
this isn't business Mr. Young, so I'll go and see
what evidence I can gather."</p>

<p>So to Dr. Forge went the detective, feeling very
bewildered over the case. And small blame to him,
for the matter was surely most perplexing. It is
only in novels that the heaven-born detective (in
the confidence of the author) displays wonderful
cleverness in finding clues where none exist. But
a flesh and blood worker like Rodgers had to puzzle
out the matter in real life as best he could. He
was not at all sanguine that he would run down the
assassin of Miss Wharf. On the face of it, Rupert
Ainsleigh appeared to be guilty, and Rodgers
doubted his guilt for this very reason. "I believe
one of these Chinaman did it," said Rodgers as he
rang Forge's bell.</p>

<p>Dr. Forge was within, and consented at once to
see the detective. When the two were in the
Chinese room, Rodgers unfolded himself, and asked
Forge, who knew the Chinese character, what he
thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear sir, the case is plain," said Forge
calmly, "Tung-yu gave Hwei the office, and lured
Miss Wharf on to the steps where Hwei strangled
her with the scarf stolen by Tung-yu so as to throw
suspicion on Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Humph. It looks like it," said Rodgers
musingly. "So you believe this wild story of Major
Tidman's."</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> it is true," said Forge quietly. "I
helped him to get free as he related. I was a partner
with Mr. Markham Ainsleigh in the mine on the
Hwei River. I went to Pekin about a concession,
and while I was away, Mr. Ainsleigh died of
dysentry. As to the fan,&mdash;I can't exactly say. I
never knew of this private god business, but it's the
kind of thing Lo-Keong might invent. He is a very
superstitious man, and like Napoleon, he believes in
his star. He was concerned in the Boxer rebellion,
but afterwards he joined the Court party of the
Dowager Empress who is now all powerful. I never
saw the fan in his hand, but it might have to do with
a secret."</p>

<p>"What kind of a secret?"</p>

<p>"I can't say unless it has to do with Lo-Keong's
political fortunes. He has many enemies, who envy
his rapid rise. These enemies <ins title="propably">probably</ins> stole the fan
to ruin him. How this coolie, who gave it to Major
Tidman, got hold of it I don't know. But he was
glad to get rid of it, which makes me think the story
of the alternate days and the blessing of the god
Kwang-ho might be true. The Chinese do not
think as we do Mr. Rodgers, and have their own way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of settling these matters. The attack on Tidman,
when he had the fan in Canton, shows clearer than
ever, that it was wanted by Lo-Keong's enemies.
He gave it to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why did you want it?"</p>

<p>"For two reasons," said Forge quietly, "in
the first place from what happened to Tidman
I saw that while he held the fan he was in
danger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But then you were in the same danger," objected
the detective.</p>

<p>"I was, and I expected trouble. But I was better
able to deal with the matter than Tidman as I
understand the Chinese character. I got the fan in
London and locked it up in yonder cabinet. I
thought it was there all the time, and when I found
it gone, I was quite annoyed, as Major Tidman will
tell you. Then I recollected that I had taken it
back to China to give to Lo-Keong. That is my
second reason Mr. Rodgers. I knew I could get a
concession I wanted through Lo-Keong's influence,
and I did. So the fan went back to him."</p>

<p>"And you forgot that you had given it."</p>

<p>"I did. It seems strange to you, but as I told
Tidman and Miss Pewsey, my memory is impaired
by opium smoking. However, that is the story of the
fan, and Burgh got it from the hand of the dead pirate.
How the pirate came possessed of it I can't say.
Apparently Lo-Keong lost it again."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have valued it much, if he lost it so
often."</p>

<p>"He valued it at five thousand pounds and more,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
said the Doctor dryly, "how it was lost I can't say.
I may find out when I go to China again, in a few
months. Lo-Keong is in Pekin, and, as we are
friends, he will tell me, and show me the fan again."</p>

<p>"Ah. Then you believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe it is on its way to Lo-Keong, and that
Tung-yu <ins title="aud">and</ins> Hwei came together down here to get
it. When only one was on the spot this god
business of alternate days made the matter difficult.
With both together, the owner of the fan was bound
to be killed or made rich. Unfortunately for Miss
Wharf the day or night was Hwei's and he carried
out the order of the god Kwang-ho by strangling
her."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rodgers rising, "all I can say is
that I'm glad I do not live in China. How much
of this is to be made public."</p>

<p>"My advice to you is to make nothing public, or
as little as you can," said Dr. Forge dryly, "you see
how persistent these Chinamen are. You make
trouble and you may be killed also. Your being in
England won't save you any more than it saved
Miss Wharf, poor soul."</p>

<p>"I shall do my duty in spite of all," said Rodgers
coolly, "I am not going to be frightened by a couple
of Chinese brutes."</p>

<p>"Very clever brutes," said Forge softly, but
Rodgers took no notice and marched away with
his head in the air. Come what may, he was
determined to punish the assassin of Miss Wharf
and if it was Hwei, the man would have to be
caught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go to Pekin myself for him," said Rodgers
angrily, "I'm not going to be bested by these
barbarians."</p>

<p>Little that was new came to his hand before the
inquest, which was a comparatively tame affair.
The jury inspected the body and then adjourned to
the Bull's Head to hear the case. Rodgers set forth
what evidence he had gained, but touched as lightly
as possible on the Chinese business. He called Dr.
Forge who deposed to having examined the body
and asserted that Miss Wharf had been killed
between eleven and twelve. She must have been
strangled almost instantaneously as, had she cried
out, she would have been over-heard by those on
the terrace. This evidence caused but little sensation.</p>

<p>When Rupert was called however, all were
excited. He deposed as to the scarf which he had
received from Olivia, and said what he had done
with it. He declared that he had been walking on
the beach smoking, and only returned to the ballroom
shortly before mid-night when the body was
discovered. He stated that he had spoken to Major
Tidman on the beach. And thus proved an alibi
clearly enough.</p>

<p>The rest of the evidence was not very important.
Chris Walker told how he had brought
Tung-yu to the ball and handed in a slip of advertisement,
and then Rupert was recalled to tell what
he knew. Tidman related his interview with
Tung-yu, and described how both had seen Rupert
place the tie in the overcoat pocket. Then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
appeared that the whole of the case turned on
the fact that the scarf had been removed from
the pocket. No one knew. Miss Pewsey said
that Rupert took it: but her evidence was so
obviously prejudiced that the jury would not believe
all she said.</p>

<p>Lotty Dean who was at the ball, declared that she
saw Miss Wharf cross the terrace about eleven and
go towards the floral arch on the other side of which
were the steps. She was quite alone, and seemed
tranquil, "she was fanning herself at the moment,"
said the witness.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Coroner, "then she had the fan at
that time."</p>

<p>"It was gone when we found the body," put in
Miss Pewsey, and was rebuked for speaking out of
order.</p>

<p>The interest of the case turned on the evidence of
Dalham, the attendant in the cloak-room. He was
a dissipated-looking man, and gave his evidence very
unwillingly. Owing to his having left the cloak-room
at Burgh's request, Rupert, as he threatened
to do, had reported him to the manager and Mr.
Dalham had been dismissed. This loss of his situation
did not make him any the sweeter towards
Ainsleigh, but all the same, he could not state on his
oath, that the young man had returned to take the
tie again from the pocket. Nor had the Chinaman,
or Major Tidman returned. Dalham knew the
Major well, and as he phrased it, "would have
spotted him at once," while the gay dress of Tung-yu
would have been equally conspicuous had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
attempted to meddle with a coat which did not
belong to him.</p>

<p>"You did not leave the room again?" asked the
Coroner.</p>

<p>"I only left it once," said Dalham. "Because
Mr. Burgh and Mr. Ainsleigh wanted to fight."</p>

<p>"We've heard about that, and it has nothing to
do with the case," said the coroner. "But you were
in the room the rest of the evening?"</p>

<p>"I've said so a dozen times sir," growled the
badgered man. "Lots of people came for their
things and some late arrivals left theirs but I was at
my post all the time, except that once, when I left
Mr. Burgh with Mr. Ainsleigh. I never saw Major
Tidman nor Mr. Ainsleigh nor the Chinaman touch
the cloak."</p>

<p>The coroner called Burgh and asked him if he
was alone in the room at any time. Clarence frankly
admitted that he was. "But as I never saw Ainsleigh
place the tie in the coat and never knew that
he possessed such a tie, I don't see how you can
accuse me." Much more evidence was given, but it
all led to no result. Finally the jury, having heard
much more of the Chinese story than Rodgers
approved of, brought in a verdict against Tung-yu.
Hwei, they could say nothing about, as he had not
been present. But Tung-yu wanted the fan and the
fan had disappeared, while Tung-yu was also
absent. "Wilful murder against Tung-yu," was the
verdict, and on hearing the evidence, and on reading
all that had been said in the papers, the general
public agreed with the verdict. Under the circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>stances
no other could have been given. Only one
person dissented.</p>

<p>"It was that Ainsleigh who killed dearest Sophia,"
said Miss Pewsey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Will</span></h4>


<p>The funeral of Miss Wharf was attended by many
people. Of course all her friends came with the
usual wreaths of flowers, but owing to the tragic
circumstances of her death, many strangers were
present. She was buried in the family vault with
much ceremony, and then the mourners departed
talking of the crime. It was the general opinion
that Tung-yu,&mdash;who had not yet been heard of,&mdash;was
responsible for the death, and that he had sailed
away in the Stormy Petrel. Rodgers having returned
to Town after the inquest was making inquiries
about the yacht. When he discovered her, he hoped
to learn particulars as to the flight of Tung-yu.</p>

<p>These many days Rupert had not seen Olivia,
although he had called at Ivy Lodge. But Miss
Pewsey, who took charge of everything in her usual
meddlesome way, would not allow him to be admitted.
Olivia did not even know of his visit. She remained
in her room, and mourned the death of her aunt.
Miss Wharf had certainly been a good friend to her,
but she could not be said to have been a kindly aunt.
All the same Olivia's conscience pricked her, for
having secretly married Rupert. As she now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
thought, she should have told her aunt. But
the marriage was decided upon in a hurry, and
when the girl had been more than usually piqued by
the insulting speeches of Miss Wharf. However,
the old woman was dead, and Olivia, little as she
loved her, wept for her tragic end.</p>

<p>Miss Rayner, during her mourning, read the
evidence given at the inquest, and wondered why
she had not been called as a witness, if only to prove
that she had given the scarf to Rupert. She thought
it extraordinary that Tung-yu should have used the
tie to strangle Miss Wharf, and could not think how
it came into his possession. After some thought she
concluded, that he had taken the scarf from Rupert's
pocket, so as to implicate him in the crime, and had
bribed Dalham the <ins title="attendent">attendant</ins>, who certainly was not
above being bribed, to say nothing about the matter.
If this were the case, Dalham would probably
blackmail Tung-yu for the rest of his life, as he was
just the kind of rascal to make money in shady
ways. Then it occurred to Olivia that as Tung-yu
had sailed for China, presumably in the yacht,
Dalham would not be able to make a milch cow of
him. However, whether Tung-yu was guilty or not,
she cared little. Rupert was safe, in spite of the
evidence of the scarf, and so long as he escaped being
arrested, the girl felt perfectly happy.</p>

<p>After the funeral Olivia came down-stairs again,
and found Miss Pewsey looking after things as usual.
The little old maid was most polite, and it seemed
as though she was now anxious to make much of
Olivia, thinking she would inherit the money. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Pewsey had not a shilling to bless herself with, and
for years had lived on the bounty of Miss Wharf.
Now that Olivia was to be the mistress of Ivy Lodge,
Miss Pewsey appeared desirous of making herself
pleasant, so that she might remain. Olivia saw
through her newly born politeness, and, although she
disliked the woman, was not averse to her remaining
for a time at least.</p>

<p>"I should be glad for you to remain altogether,"
explained Olivia when matters came to be discussed,
"but of course now that my aunt is gone I may marry
Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Oh he'll marry you quick enough for your
money," snapped Miss Pewsey, "not but what he's
a handsome young fellow, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't run down Rupert," interrupted Olivia
flushing, "I love him. You have never been just to
him."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey coughed. "I don't think he is a very
good young man."</p>

<p>"I hate good young men," said Olivia. "Mr.
Chris Walker is one of those who never cost his
mother a single pang. Why my aunt should wish
me to marry such a milksop, I can't understand."</p>

<p>"Well then, why not marry Clarence?" asked the
old maid, "he is not a milksop and has cost his
mother&mdash;poor soul many a pang. And he loves you
dearly, Olivia. I should think you would be able to
live very nicely on five hundred a year and with this
house rent free."</p>

<p>"If I come into possession of the property that is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure you will," said Miss Pewsey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
effusively. "To whom should dear Sophia leave the
money, if not to you, her nearest relative."</p>

<p>"She might have left it to you, for she loved you,
while she only tolerated me."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey threw up her mittened hands with a
cry of dismay. "Oh my dear there's no chance of
my being so lucky. Sophia was very close about
money matters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely not with you, Miss Pewsey. She always
consulted you in everything. You had great influence
over her."</p>

<p>"If so, I made no use of it for my own benefit,"
said Miss Pewsey with great dignity. "Sophia
never consulted me about her wills. I know she
made several, and dictated the last just a week
before her death. While she was confined to her
room with that cold you know, Olivia. I suppose,"
Miss Pewsey tittered, "I suppose she wanted to be
amused."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think making one's will was amusing,"
said Olivia dryly, "however, the lawyer will be
here this afternoon to read the will, and we shall
know if I inherit."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will get the money. And dear,
you won't forget your poor Lavinia," purred Miss
Pewsey. "Let me remain here with you, until you
marry Mr. Ainsleigh, or until I marry Theophilus."</p>

<p>"Are you really going to marry Dr. Forge?"
asked Miss Rayner, looking with secret amazement
at the withered face and shrunken form of Miss
Pewsey and wondering what the doctor could see in
her to make her his wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I really am," said Miss Pewsey emphatically and
with a shrewd look in her eyes. "And I see that
you think it is ridiculous at my age to marry. Also,
I am not handsome I know. All the same, Theophilus
is willing to make me Mrs. Forge, and I dare
say I'll grace the position well enough. It isn't love,"
added Miss Pewsey, "at our age dear that would be
too absurd. We are simply entering into a partnership.
He has money and I have brains."</p>

<p>"Dr. Forge has brains also."</p>

<p>"Not so much brain power as I have. I am not
lovely I know dear, but I am clever," and Miss
Pewsey drew herself up proudly. "Why poor dear
Sophia would never have died worth so much money
but for me. Ah, if she had only given me that fan
when I asked her, she would not have been killed
and I should have got five thousand pounds and
more from Tung-yu for her. But she would keep
the fan," Miss Pewsey squeezed out a tear, "and so
met with her doom. That nasty Chinaman." Miss
Pewsey shook a small fist. "I wish he could hang."</p>

<p>Olivia looked at her. "I heard that you disagreed
with the verdict Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>"Meaning that I said Mr. Ainsleigh was guilty,"
snapped the old maid, "well I did, dear, but I have
changed my mind."</p>

<p>Miss Rayner did not believe this, for Miss Pewsey
looked very malignant as she spoke. Her change
of opinion was made, merely to adapt herself to
circumstances and to retain a home until such time
as her marriage with Forge, would enable her to
dispense with Miss Rayner's help. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Olivia did not argue the point. She wished to
keep on good terms with the old maid, until Rupert
declared the secret marriage. Then she could go to
the Abbey, and leave Miss Pewsey behind with all
other disagreeable things.</p>

<p>With Pastor, the solicitor of the deceased lady,
came Clarence Burgh and Dr. Forge. Lady Jabe,
more manly than ever, appeared with Chris
Walker, who had taken a holiday on purpose to hear
the will read, and Lady Jabe explained this to Miss
Pewsey in a whisper. "I know that poor Sophia
wished Chris to marry Olivia," she said, "so I
thought the will might state that the money would be
left to her on such a condition. I therefore made
Chris ask for a holiday, so that he might hear of his
good fortune."</p>

<p>"Let us hope it will come," aid Miss Pewsey,
dryly, "but fortune or no fortune, Olivia will stick
to young Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"He is a nice young man, but poor."</p>

<p>"Chris is poor also. Yet you want him to marry
Olivia."</p>

<p>"I think Chris has a better character than young
Ainsleigh, who looks as though he has a will of his
own. Now Chris has none. I have broken it, and
Olivia as Mrs. Walker, can order him about like a
slave. I hope Sophia has made the will as I wished."</p>

<p>"You'll hear in a minute. For my part," added
Miss Pewsey in her spiteful way, "I hope Sophia
has left the money to Olivia, on condition that she
marries Clarence, and keeps him at home."</p>

<p>"And keeps him on the income," corrected Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Jabe, who did not at all approve of this speech.
"No man should live on his wife."</p>

<p>"You propose that Chris should do so."</p>

<p>"Indeed no. He earns quite a good salary at the
office, and I could live with the young couple to
prevent waste."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure you would," said Miss Pewsey,
"if you get the money."</p>

<p>Lady Jabe would have made a sharp reply, as
Miss Wharf being dead, she was under no obligation
to curry favour with Miss Pewsey. But at that
moment she saw Chris talking to Olivia, and as the
girl seemed deeply interested, she pointed out the
two with her cane. "I see Chris is losing no time,"
she murmured, "such a lover as he is."</p>

<p>But had she heard Chris talking, she would not
have been so happy. The young man was simply
replying to a question put by Olivia, as to the
whereabouts of Tung-yu. "I really don't know
where he is, Miss Rayner," said Chris, earnestly.
"There was a police-officer at our place the other
day inquiring. But Tung-yu has not been near
Kum-gum Li's since I took him to the ball. I
believe he asked me to get him an invitation so that
he might kill your aunt."</p>

<p>"Does Kum-gum Li know anything about
him," asked Olivia.</p>

<p>"No. He came with a letter of introduction
from a mandarin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong?"</p>

<p>"No. That is not the name&mdash;let me see&mdash;the
Mandarin, Hop Sing&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said Forge, who was listening, "Lo-Keong's
rival."</p>

<p>"I never knew that. But Kum-gum Li gave
Tung-yu a place as extra clerk when he received
the letter. He knows nothing more than what the
letter explained."</p>

<p>"And what did it explain?" asked Forge with
sudden interest.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," replied Chris coldly, "I am
not in the confidence of my employer, and if I were,"
he added fixing an indignant eye on the sardonic
face of the doctor, "I should say nothing."</p>

<p>"Quite right," replied Forge not at all disconcerted,
"you keep out of these Chinese affairs.
There's danger in them."</p>

<p>"Connected with the fan?" demanded Olivia.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Forge slowly, "connected with the
fan."</p>

<p>Olivia being a woman and curious, would have
asked further questions, to which Dr. Forge might
have hesitated to reply, but that Miss Pewsey called
her dear Theophilus to her side. The will was
about to be read and Miss Pewsey&mdash;so she said&mdash;wanted
support. Forge crossed to the withered
little shrimp he had chosen, heaven knows why, for
his wife and sat down. The lawyer opened an
envelope and took out a rustling parchment. Just as
he cleared his throat, the door opened and the maid
announced "Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey glared, and no one appeared glad to
see him, Lady Jabe least of all, as she knew he was
a powerful rival to Chris. But Rupert bowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the company in silence, took no notice of their cold
looks, and walked over to where Olivia sat, a little
apart. He seated himself beside her. The girl smiled
a little faintly, and then gazed straight before her.
No one made any remark, as Pastor was beginning
to read the will.</p>

<p>Miss Wharf, it appeared, died worth one thousand
a year and the house and furniture and land of Ivy
Lodge. Five hundred a year went to a distant
relative, as Miss Wharf was unable to leave it to
anyone else, by reason of only having a life interest
in this amount. Then a few personal bequests were
left to Lady Jabe, to Chris Walker, and to some
other friends. Ivy Lodge, and the furniture, and
the land it was built on, and the remaining five
hundred a year was left to&mdash;Lavinia Pewsey. When
the name was mentioned the little old maid quivered,
and Olivia, pale and quiet, rose to her feet. In a
moment Miss Pewsey, prepared for battle, was on
her feet also, and the two women looked at one
another.</p>

<p>"You knew of this will," said Olivia quietly.</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Pewsey.</p>

<p>"You did. And all your paying court to me was
a blind, so that I might not suspect Aunt Sophia
had left the money to you."</p>

<p>"Dearest Sophia left the money to whom she
chose," said Miss Pewsey, in a sharp, shrill voice, "do
you mean to say, that I exercised any undue influence
over her?"</p>

<p>"I say nothing," was Olivia's reply: "but hard
on me as my aunt was, I do not think she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
have left me penniless, while the money which belonged
to my family goes to a perfect stranger."</p>

<p>"A stranger," cried Miss Pewsey tossing her head,
"am I a stranger, indeed? I was hand and glove
with dear Sophia when we were at school together.
I gave up my life to her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you have got your reward," said Olivia bitterly.</p>

<p>"As you say," retorted Miss Pewsey, tossing her
head again, "but the will is in order, and I had
nothing to do with the making of it. I appeal to
Mr. Pastor."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said the lawyer, looking on
Olivia with something like pity. "Miss Wharf gave
me instructions to make a new will, during the
week before she met with her untimely end. Miss
Pewsey was not in the room&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But no doubt she induced my aunt to cut me
out of the will."</p>

<p>"No," cried Miss Pewsey breathing very hard,
and looking more drab than ever. "I won't stand
this. Your aunt had good cause to take the money
from you&mdash;oh you deceiving girl."</p>

<p>At this Rupert suddenly rose and took Olivia's
hand. He half guessed what was coming, and
looked at the spiteful face of the heiress. Olivia
stared. She could not understand. Miss Pewsey
was about to speak, when Mr. Pastor intervened.</p>

<p>"May I be permitted to remark that I have not
finished reading the will of the deceased lady," said
he sweetly.</p>

<p>"There's no more money to be disposed of," said
Olivia bitterly, "my enemy has got it all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Pastor made a gesture of silence to prevent Miss
Pewsey bursting out into a volume of words.
"There is no more money to be disposed of as you
say, Miss Rayner, but Miss Wharf sets forth in the
will why she disinherited you."</p>

<p>"Ah," cried Olivia a light breaking in upon her,
and reading the truth in Miss Pewsey's look of
triumph, "so my aunt knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She knew that you had secretly married the
gentleman beside you."</p>

<p>Everyone was on his or her feet by this time,
and every look was directed towards Olivia. "Is
this true?" asked Lady Jabe.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Miss Pewsey, before either Rupert
or Olivia could speak, "of course it is true.
Let them deny it if they can. I heard Olivia
say herself, that she had been married at a
registrar's."</p>

<p>Miss Rayner, or rather Mrs. Ainsleigh turned on
the little woman, "I should like to know when I
said that to you Miss Pewsey?"</p>

<p>"You never said it to me&mdash;oh dear no," said Miss
Pewsey shrilly, "you were not straightforward
enough. But I heard&mdash;oh yes I heard."</p>

<p>"Miss Wharf," said the lawyer folding up the
will, "told me that she learned of this from Miss
Pewsey, just before she called me in, to make a new
will. The five hundred a year was left to you
Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ainsleigh," said Rupert quickly.</p>

<p>"Very good. To you Mrs. Ainsleigh, by a former
will. But on discovering the secret marriage, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
client made a new will&mdash;this," he shook it, "and
Miss Pewsey benefits."</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey has every right to benefit," said
Mrs. Ainsleigh in a clear cold voice, "she has been
well paid, for being a spy."</p>

<p>"Spy," shrilled Miss Pewsey glaring, "yes I was
a spy in the interests of dearest Sophia. I followed
you several times, when you went to meet Mr.
Ainsleigh near the flag-staff, and on the last
occasion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Olivia tranquilly, "so I thought. I
heard something moving. It was you, concealed.
Rupert said it was a rat&mdash;perhaps he was right.
Well Miss Pewsey you have gained your ends and
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you leave my house," said the old maid,
"yes, my house."</p>

<p>Olivia made no reply but placed her hand within
her husband's arm. Rupert conducted her towards
the door. "Mrs. Ainsleigh's effects will be sent
for," said he looking at Miss Pewsey, "we will not
trouble you further."</p>

<p>"But the law will trouble <i>you</i>," cried Miss
Pewsey, "you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rupert turned and looked at her. The venomous
words died on her lips. She dropped into her
chair, while Ainsleigh and the disinherited Olivia
left Ivy Lodge to the woman, who had schemed for
it in so base a way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Mysterious Letter</span></h4>


<p>If Miss Wharf's tragic death made a great sensation
in Marport, the announcement that Miss
Rayner was married secretly to Ainsleigh of Royabay
made a still greater one. Some people thought
Olivia had behaved badly to her aunt, and these
were confirmed in their belief, by the story told by
Miss Pewsey. But others considered the marriage
to be quite romantic, and, knowing how Miss Wharf
had tried to make her <ins title="neice">niece</ins> marry Clarence, were
pleased that the girl had thus circumvented the
schemes of the buccaneer. But, whether the critics
were hostile or favourable, they were all equally
anxious to call at Royabay and see its new mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ainsleigh received them quietly, and with a
dignity which compelled all to refrain from making
remarks, unpleasant or otherwise. She settled down
rapidly to her new position, and after a time, everyone
was quite on her side. Certainly, a few ill-disposed
people agreed with Miss Pewsey, who could not say
anything sufficiently bad about Mrs. Ainsleigh: but
on the whole, people were anxious to welcome the
new mistress of the great place of Marport. Rupert
and Olivia appeared to be very happy, and after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>&mdash;as
someone said, "the marriage was their own
business."</p>

<p>A month after the installation of Olivia at Royabay,
her husband received a visitor in the person of
Dr. Forge. That melancholy man made his appearance
one afternoon, when the young couple were in
the garden, and therefore, they could not refuse to
see him. Olivia, had she been able, would certainly
have declined the visit, as she was aware that Forge
intended to marry Miss Pewsey next month. As it
was, she had to be polite and she was coldly so.
Rupert also, was not very genial. From what John
Petley had said, and from what Tung-yu had hinted,
he began to think that Forge was not the friend he
pretended to be, and consequently the young man
was on his guard. Dr. Forge saw this, and seized
the opportunity when Olivia went within,&mdash;which
she did as soon as politeness permitted,&mdash;to speak to
his quondam ward.</p>

<p>"We don't appear to be friends," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can expect it," replied
Rupert coldly, "you marry Miss Pewsey next
month, and she has been, and is, Olivia's bitter
enemy."</p>

<p>"I am aware that my future wife is prejudiced,"
said he deliberately, "but I assure you Rupert, she
did not scheme for that money."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh scoffed. "Why she spied on Olivia
and told Miss Wharf, what we would rather had
been kept silent."</p>

<p>"I don't think you acted quite fairly towards
Miss Wharf."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is my business. I don't intend to defend
myself," was the young man's reply, "did you come
to discuss this matter?"</p>

<p>"No. I came to ask how this matter would effect
your future."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"In the way you stand with your creditors."</p>

<p>Rupert did not reply immediately. The two were
walking on the lawn, but Rupert entered the door of
the Abbey and strolled round the ruins with Forge
by his side. He mistrusted the man intensely. "I
should like to know if you are my friend?" he asked,
giving utterance to this mistrust.</p>

<p>"Surely I am," was the quiet reply, "why should
you think me to be otherwise. Because I marry
Miss Pewsey?"</p>

<p>"No. You can marry whom you choose. I have
nothing to do with that, Dr. Forge. But when you
were my guardian, why did you not tell me that the
property was so encumbered?"</p>

<p>"I wanted your boyhood to be unclouded. And
also," he added, seeing Rupert make a gesture of
contempt, "I thought you might get money from
China."</p>

<p>Rupert started. "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Forge deliberately and looking on
the ground, "you know that your father and I
invested in a gold mine on the Hwei River? Well
we worked it for a long time until your father died
of dysentery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure he died of dysentery?" asked
Ainsleigh sharply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"So far as I know he did," was Forge's patient
reply, "as I told you before, I was in Pekin when
he died. But if you are in doubt you should go to
China and ask Lo-Keong."</p>

<p>"What has he to do with it?"</p>

<p>"This much," said Forge quietly, "and I am telling
you, what I have kept hitherto from every living
creature. Your father and I made money out of
the mine&mdash;a great sum. I made the most&mdash;about
ten thousand pounds, but your father made at least
eight thousand."</p>

<p>"And where is that money?" asked Rupert
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong has it. Yes! I went to Pekin to
get a concession with regard to buying or leasing
more land. I left your father with Lo-Keong. He
was at that time a kind of foreman. But also, <ins title="he he">he</ins>
was in the confidence of the rebellious Boxer
leaders. These threatened to undermine the power
of the Dowager Empress, who was not then, so
strong as she is now. As a matter of fact, Lo-Keong
himself was a leader of the Boxers. He came to us
in disguise, and worked up until he became our
foreman; but he did this, because he heard that the
mine was paying, and wanted money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your money?" asked Ainsleigh deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the money belonging to your father&mdash;in
all, eighteen thousand pounds. When I was at
Pekin, your father, who did not understand the
Chinese so well as I did, managed to make trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"He interfered with the religion of the coolies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
some way&mdash;a most disastrous thing to do. Lo-Keong
took advantage of the riot and robbed your
father of the eighteen thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"And killed my father."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Forge quietly, "I really can't say
that. <ins title="It was it">It was</ins> reported to me at Pekin that Markham
had died of dysentery. He was buried near
the mine. I was advised not to go back, as the
Chinese were enraged against the foreign devils.
Lo-Keong took the money and returned to his
Boxers, where, with the money, he attained to even
greater power, than he formerly had possessed.
Afterwards he deserted his party and came on the
side of the Empress Dowager. She is a clever woman
and was glad to get him, so he speedily rose high at
court. Now, he is very powerful."</p>

<p>"And still holds my father's money."</p>

<p>"Precisely, and mine also. I have been to China,
again and again, to try and make Lo-Keong give up
this money, and then, I intended to pay you eight
thousand pounds. But hitherto I have failed. I am
about to make a last attempt, as I sail for Canton
after Christmas. I had intended to go earlier, but I
must marry Miss Pewsey and leave her in charge of
my house, as Mrs. Forge, before I go. So now you
know Rupert why I went so frequently to China."</p>

<p>"And what has the fan to do with all this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so far as I know. It is Lo-Keong's
property and was a bequest which he values. I
understand that there is some secret belonging to it,
connected with political affairs, and which make his
enemies anxious to get hold of it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't you know the secret, when you possessed
the fan?"</p>

<p>"No," said Forge viciously, "I wish I had known
it. If it could have damaged Lo-Keong I certainly
should have made every use of it. He keeps me out of
ten thousand pounds, and it's through his influence
with the Empress Dowager that I am prevented
from working the mine further. It is a rich mine,
and if I worked it, I could make a fortune. But Lo-Keong
stopped that. I was a fool, not to use the fan
and make Lo-Keong give me the mine for it."</p>

<p>"But you <i>did</i> give him the fan."</p>

<p>Forge looked confused for a moment. "Yes, I
did," said he after a pause, "that is, it was taken
from me. I got it from Tidman in the way you
know, and always expected trouble. But I expect
Hwei and Tung-yu did not find out at the time, that
it had come to this country, so I was left alone.
Had they discovered, that I was the possessor I
should have been killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or you might have got a large sum of
money."</p>

<p>"Quite so. It would have all depended if I gave
the fan to Hwei or to Tung-yu. I should have
preferred the latter, but of course I never knew the
different days appointed by the god."</p>

<p>"Then that business is really true."</p>

<p>"I believe it is. But I never knew much about
it, till Tung-yu told me. Then it was too late, Miss
Wharf had the fan, and it was Hwei's day. He
took advantage of the chance."</p>

<p>"Do you think he was here?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Certainly. He killed Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"But the verdict said that Tung-yu&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh&mdash;pooh," cried Forge snapping his long
fingers. "Tung-yu would not have dared to
disobey the order of Kwang-ho the god. Hwei is
the culprit, but I said as little as I could about that,
I don't want to be entangled in the matter again.
But one of the Chinamen has the fan, and by this
time it is nearly at Pekin. There doesn't seem
to be much chance of our getting that money
Rupert."</p>

<p>"You did give the fan to Lo-Keong," reiterated
Ainsleigh.</p>

<p>"Well it was taken from me. I went to his
palace and told him I would give him the fan in
exchange for the eighteen thousand pounds. I then
intended to come back and give you eight, to clear
off your mortgages and resolved to live on the
remaining ten which are rightfully my own. But Lo-Keong
had me seized, and the fan was taken from
me. He then forbade me setting foot in China
again. But I am going, for all that," said Forge
threateningly, "I shall go after Christmas. I am
bound to get my money and yours."</p>

<p>"You kept that fan for a long time?"</p>

<p>"For two years only, and then, when I thought
everything had blown over, I took it to Lo-Keong
with what result you know. Now then, I have been
plain with you Rupert. Surely you can see that I
am your friend."</p>

<p>"Tung-yu said you were not, Doctor."</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied Forge, "he wanted to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
bad blood between us, so that I should not tell you
this story. How does he know&mdash;Tung-yu I mean&mdash;but
what you might not go to China and complain
about Lo-Keong keeping this money."</p>

<p>"I prefer to stop here with my wife," said Ainsleigh.
"But <i>you</i> can complain."</p>

<p>"And be hanged, or sliced, or shot, or fried. No
thank you. Remember what kind of treatment
Tidman met with at the hands of Hwei."</p>

<p>"What. Was he the one-eyed Chinaman?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's the gentleman, and I hope he won't
come your way. He is a beast. But by this time,
he and Tung-yu are on their way back to their own
land. And now Rupert, I'll say good-bye. As I am
poor myself, lacking this ten thousand pounds,
rightfully mine, which Lo-Keong detains, I can't
help you. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get
Miss Pewsey to extend that mortgage."</p>

<p>"No, thank you all the same," said Ainsleigh,
throwing back his head.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be indebted to your wife."</p>

<p>"She is not my wife <i>yet</i>," said Forge significantly.</p>

<p>"But you intend to marry her."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;quite so." Forge looked queerly at
Rupert, as though about to say something. Then he
changed his mind and walked away rapidly, without
saying good-bye. Rupert returned to the house and
told his wife all that had taken place. She was still
doubtful of Forge's good intentions.</p>

<p>"A decent man would not marry that wicked little
woman."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rupert doubtfully, "from the way he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
spoke and looked, I think Miss Pewsey marries him
and not Forge, Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ainsleigh looked up quickly. "Has she got
any hold over him?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand dear?"</p>

<p>"The same as she had over my aunt. Rupert,
that little woman looks frail, but she is strong, and
has a will like iron. In spite of her looks, Aunt
Sophia was wax in Miss Pewsey's hands. She
exercised a kind of hypnotic power over Aunt Sophia,
and that was how the will came to be made in her
favour."</p>

<p>"In that case, why not try and upset the
will."</p>

<p>"On a pretext of undue influence. It could be
done certainly, but I have no facts to go upon. But
it seems to me, from what you say, that Miss
Pewsey has hypnotised Forge."</p>

<p>"He's not the kind of man to be hypnotised."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is. He smokes opium. A man who
would give way to that vice, is not a strong man.
But let her be and let him be also, Rupert. I don't
believe about this money in China. It is no use our
building on that. If the place has to be sold at the
end of the year, we will take what we have left and
go to Canada. So long as I have my boy I don't
much care," and she wreathed her arms round his
neck.</p>

<p>"Dear Olivia, I wish I wasn't the hard-up wretch
I am."</p>

<p>"I would not have you, any other than you are.
If money comes to us, it will come honestly, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
through the hands of Dr. Forge or his future wife.
Neither one is honest."</p>

<p>Rupert would have argued this point, as he thought
his wife was a trifle hard. But Olivia stuck to her
guns, and gradually all reference to Forge and his
story was dropped by tacit consent. The young
couple had quite enough to do, in talking of their
future, which was doubtful, to say the least of it.
However Rupert had arranged with the lawyers to
hold over all claims for another year. It only remained
to get Miss Pewsey, who now held the fatal
mortgage, to extend the time. But Olivia would not
allow her husband to ask a favour of the bitter little
woman as she was sure,&mdash;and rightly so,&mdash;that it
would not be granted. The mortgage held by Miss
Pewsey was for three thousand pounds, and the two
set their wits to work, to see if they could pay this
off by Christmas. Then, they would have a good few
months left to arrange other matters. If possible,
Olivia wished to keep Royabay, though the outlook
was not cheering.</p>

<p>Another month slipped by, but few changes took
place in Marport. As it was now rather wintry,
so many people did not come down to the sea-side.
Rupert and Olivia lived rather a lonely life at the
Abbey, but being very much in love, this did not
disturb them: in fact it was rather a pleasure.
Sometimes Chris Walker and his aunt called. Lady
Jabe had got over her disappointment, now that
Olivia was poor, and constantly abused Miss Pewsey
for taking the money. She was making the unfortunate
Chris pay attentions to Lotty Dean, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
father was a grocer and had ample wealth. Things
were going on nicely in this quarter, and Lady Jabe
was pleased.</p>

<p>Clarence Burgh had left Marport and was now
amusing himself in London. Sometimes he came
down to see his aunt, who was getting ready for her
bridal and still lived in Ivy Lodge. There, Forge
intended to remove when married, as the house was
rent free, and already he had given notice to Tidman
as the Major told Rupert one evening. "And
I'm glad he's going," said the Major, as he sat with
his usual bottle of port before the fire, after dinner,
"I couldn't stand seeing, that Pewsey cat in my
house as Mrs. Doctor Forge."</p>

<p>"I wonder why he marries her?" said Rupert
who was smoking on the other side of the fire
place.</p>

<p>"Because he is frightened of her, sir. That
woman for some reason makes everyone frightened
of her&mdash;except me," added the Major swelling, "why
even that young Burgh hardly comes to see her,
though he's down here now&mdash;waiting for the wedding
I suppose. It comes off next week and a nice fright
that Pewsey cat will look as a bride."</p>

<p>Rupert laughed. Olivia had left the room and
retired to bed. The Major, who had been fidgeting
all the evening, looked round when alone with his
host. "I want to talk to you," he said.</p>

<p>"What about? Haven't you been talking all the
evening."</p>

<p>"Not on the subject nearest to my heart," said
Tidman sipping his port. "I waited till Mrs. Ains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>leigh
went away, as I don't want to revive unpleasant
memories."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Rupert with a shudder, "surely you
are not going to talk of the murder."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;certainly not: but I am of the thing that
caused it."</p>

<p>Rupert sat up quickly. "The fan. Why that's in
China. Tung-yu took it, after he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tung-yu did <i>not</i> take it," said the Major producing
a letter. "I thought he did, if you remember,
for you and I saw him on the beach on that night."</p>

<p>"Yes. He was talking to a boatman."</p>

<p>"Arranging for his flight," said Tidman grimly,
"and then he went back, as I thought, and murdered
that woman. But he didn't," the Major paused to
give full dramatic effect. "He thinks I did it."</p>

<p>"Oh, rubbish," said Rupert. "If you can prove
an alibi on my behalf, I can prove one on yours.
We walked and talked on the beach, till nearly
twelve. Then you went back to your bed, and I
returned to the ball-room. Immediately afterwards
the body was found. What makes Tung-yu accuse
you, and why do you get a letter from China?"</p>

<p>"It's not from China, but from London."</p>

<p>"Is Tung-yu there?" asked Ainsleigh, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes. In some place in Rotherhithe. He writes
from there, in this letter. Read it," and he passed
it to his host.</p>

<p>Rupert glanced over the few lines which were
very neatly written on yellow paper. The letter
was to the effect that if Major Tidman would bring
the fan to a certain place in Rotherhithe, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
receive the money. "Humph," said Ainsleigh,
handing it back, "so it seems that Tung-yu has not
got the fan."</p>

<p>"Yes, confound him, and he thinks <i>I</i> have it, in
which case he must believe that I murdered Miss
Wharf."</p>

<p>Rupert nodded. "It looks like it," said he,
"what will you do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I do not want another Canton
adventure. I thought," here the Major hesitated,
"I thought you might go."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh did not burst out into a voluble refusal,
as Tidman expected, but stared at the fire. Seeing
this, Tidman urged his point. "I think if you
went, you might get at the truth of the matter," he
said. "If Tung-yu didn't murder Miss Wharf,
who did? Will you go?"</p>

<p>Rupert still gazed at the fire. He was thinking
of the eight thousand pounds due to him, held by
Lo-Keong and which, if gained, would pay off Miss
Pewsey. "Yes," said he at length, "I'll go."</p>

<p>It was a risk, as he knew, but the money was
worth the risk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Rotherhithe Den</span></h4>


<p>As a rule, Rupert told his wife everything, thinking
there could be no happiness, unless a married
couple were frank with one another. Also, he frequently
went to Olivia for advice, believing in the
keen feminine instinct, which usually sees what is
hidden from the denser masculine understanding.
But on this occasion, he refrained from revealing
the object of his visit to London, as he knew she
would be feverishly anxious, all the time he was
absent. It was just possible that Hwei might be at
Rotherhithe instead of Tung-yu, and then Rupert
might meet with a death similar to that of Miss
Wharf. Certainly he had not the fan, and never
did possess it; but how was he to convince a distrustful
Asiatic of that.</p>

<p>Therefore, Rupert went to town one afternoon by
the nine o'clock evening train from Marport, and
Olivia thought, he was merely going to see his
lawyer on business connected with Miss Pewsey's
mortgage. Her husband was to return the next
day in time for luncheon, and, as he had often run
up to town before, Olivia had no misgivings. Had
she been aware of the danger he was going into, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
assuredly would not have let him go. Mrs. Ainsleigh
had led an unhappy life, and now that things
were brighter, she certainly did not wish to see her
days clouded, by the loss of the husband whom she
loved so dearly.</p>

<p>As what money there was, went to keep up
Royabay, its master was too poor to travel first
class. But he was lucky enough to find a third
class smoking carriage empty, and sat down very
content. Owing to the nature of his errand, he
wished to be alone, to think out his mode of procedure.
Tung-yu would not be an easy person to
deal with, still less would Hwei, should he happen
to be on the spot, and Ainsleigh had little knowledge
of the Chinese character. From what Forge said,
he judged it to be dangerous.</p>

<p>There were few people travelling by the train,
and Rupert quite believed that he would have the
compartment to himself. But just as the train was
moving off, a man dashed into the carriage and
dropped breathlessly on the seat. "I guess that
was a narrow squeak," he gasped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burgh," said Rupert, by no means pleased.</p>

<p>"Well, I am surprised," said the buccaneer, "if
it ain't Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ainsleigh," was Rupert's reply, for he disliked
the man too much to tolerate this familiarity.</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks," retorted Burgh wiping his forehead,
"'tisn't any use putting on frills with me, sir.
I guess I'm as good a man as you, any day."</p>

<p>"Let us admit you are better," said Rupert coldly,
"and cease conversation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>But this Mr. Burgh was not inclined to do. "I
reckon this old tram won't stop at any station for
half an hour," said he pulling out a long black cigar,
"so I don't see why we should sit like dummies for
thirty minutes. Come along, let's yarn. You think
I'm a wrong un'. Well, I guess I'm no holy Bill if
that's what you mean. But I surmise that I'm
friendly enough with you, Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Our last interview was not of a friendly
character."</p>

<p>"You bet. You laid me out proper, and gave it
to me pretty free. I respect a man who knocks me
down. I thought you'd curl up when faced, Ainsleigh,
but I see you're a fighter. That being so,
why I climb down. Not that I'm a coward&mdash;oh,
no&mdash;not by a long chalk: but I know how to size
up things."</p>

<p>"And how do you size them up in this case?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Clarence lighting up, "I guess
you've got the bulge on me. I was sweet on your
wife, but you aimed a bulls-eye, and I got left.
That being so, I conclude to leave other man's goods
alone."</p>

<p>"Meaning Mrs. Ainsleigh," said Rupert dryly,
"thank you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no thanks. I've got enough sins already
without putting a gilded roof on my iniquities. See
here," Clarence leaned forward and looked agreeable,
though his wicked black eyes snapped fire, "why
shouldn't you and I be friends?"</p>

<p>Rupert did not reply at once. He did not like
Burgh, who was an aggressive bully of the Far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
West. All the same, something might be learned
from Burgh, relative to the murder, and to the
Chinaman. He knew Hwei and knew something of
the fan, so Rupert resolved to be on reasonably
friendly terms with the buccaneer in the hope of
learning something likely to be of use. If Mr.
Burgh had a lantern, there was no reason why
Ainsleigh should not use the light to illuminate his
somewhat dark path. Therefore, when Rupert did
speak, it was to express a wish to be friendly. Yet,
strange to say, as soon as he showed a disposition
to come forward, Clarence, the wary, showed an
equal disposition to retire. "Ho," said the buccaneer,
"I guess you want my help, or you wouldn't
be so friendly all at once."</p>

<p>"I am friendly by your own desire," said Ainsleigh
dryly, "if you like, we need not talk, but can
part as enemies."</p>

<p>"No," said Burgh throwing himself indolently
back on the cushions, "fact is, I need you and you
need me."</p>

<p>"How do I need you?" asked Rupert sharply.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Clarence, eying the clear-cut face
of his late enemy, "it's just this way. Aunt
Lavinia's an old cat. She was all square with me,
so long as she thought I'd hitch up <ins title="longside">alongside</ins> Miss
Rayner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ainsleigh if you please, and leave out her
name."</p>

<p>"Right oh. I'll use it only once. Aunty thought
I'd annex the cash, and Mrs. Ainsleigh, and that
she would live on the pair of us. But as things are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Aunty has the cash and you've got the lady, so I
am left&mdash;yes sir. I guess I've been bested by
Aunty. Well sir, I calculate I'm not a millionaire,
and I want cash to start out on the long trail.
Aunty won't part, shabby old puss that she is; but
I reckon if you'll help me, I'll rake in the dollars
slick."</p>

<p>"Why should I help you?"</p>

<p>"To get square about that murder."</p>

<p>Rupert drew back, "Do you know?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh I know nothing for certain, or I shouldn't
take you into partnership, but I believe I can spot
the person."</p>

<p>"Surely you don't think Miss Pewsey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no. She wouldn't harm anyone, unless she
was on the right side. She's a cat, but is clever
enough to keep herself from being lynched. 'Sides,
she was comfortable enough with old Wharf, and
wouldn't have sent her to camp out in the New
Jerusalem, by strangling. But Aunty's going to
hitch up long-side old Forge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he?" asked Rupert secretly excited, but
looking calm enough.</p>

<p>"Go slow. I don't know anything for certain,
but I guess Forge had a finger in the pie. He
wanted the fan you know."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! He had the fan for two years and
made no use of it."</p>

<p>"I reckon not. He didn't know its secret&mdash;and
the secret's worth money I judge."</p>

<p>"Do you know the secret?"</p>

<p>"No. If I'd known I shouldn't have passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
article along to old Wharf. But I'm hunting for
the secret, and when I find it out, I'll shake old
Forge's life out for that fan."</p>

<p>"But Tung-yu has the fan?"</p>

<p>"Ho!" snorted the buccaneer, "and Tung-yu's
gone to China with Hwei and the fan. Shucks!
They gassed that at the inquest, but the poppy-cock
don't go down along o' me. No Sir. I guess old
Forge has the article. Now you sail in with me,
and find out."</p>

<p>"How can I?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the buccaneer reflectively, "your
father was a friend of the doctor's and he's chums
with you. Just you get him to be confidential like,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forge is the last man to be confidential with
anyone," said Rupert coldly, "and if this be your
scheme I can't help you. There is not a shred of
evidence to prove that Forge killed Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"No. That's a frozen fact; but I guess I'm
going to straighten out Forge to pay out Aunty.
Then both will have to part with cash for my going
on the long trail. I'm in the dark now, but
later&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>An end was put to Mr. Burgh's chatter by the
stoppage of the train at a station, and by the entrance
of a joyful party of father, mother and three
children. These last returning from a happy day in
the country made themselves agreeable by crying.
Clarence closed his mouth, and only bent forward to
say one last word to Rupert, "I reckon we'll talk of
this to-morrow when I get back to Marport," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
he, "I'm putting up at the Bristol, and aunty's footing
the bill."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh nodded and buried himself in his own
thoughts. He did not see how Clarence could bring
the crime home to Dr. Forge, but the buccaneer
evidently had his suspicions. Rupert resolved to
keep in with Burgh on the chance that something
might come of the matter. He saw well enough
that Clarence, in desperate want of money, would do
all in his power to prove Forge guilty and would then
blackmail him and Miss Pewsey, or, as she would
then be, Mrs. Forge. This last design which Rupert
suspected Burgh entertained, he resolved should not
be put into practice: but if Forge was guilty, he
would be arrested and tried. Therefore when
Clarence parted with Ainsleigh at the Liverpool
street station, the latter was moderately friendly.</p>

<p>"'Night," said the buccaneer wringing Ainsleigh's
hand. "See you to-morrow at Marport. Keep it
dark," and he winked and disappeared.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh moved towards the barrier to give up
his ticket. As he did so he was roughly jostled, but
could not see the person who thus banged against
him. He left the station however, with the feeling
that he was being followed, and kept looking back to
see if, amongst the crowd, there was any special
person at his heels. But he could see no one with
his eyes on him. Yet the feeling continued even
when he got into the underground train, which was
to take him to Rotherhithe.</p>

<p>The young man had put on a shabby suit of blue
serge for the adventure and,&mdash;as the night was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
rainy,&mdash;wore a heavy over-coat, the same in fact,
which he had left in the cloak-room of the Bristol
hotel on that memorable occasion. The compartment
was filled with a rather rough set of workmen
going home, and some were the worse for liquor. However
Rupert sitting quietly in his own corner was not
disturbed and arrived in Rotherhithe without trouble.
He was thankful for this, as he did not wish to have
a row when engaged on a secret errand.</p>

<p>It was dark and stormy when he stepped out into
the street, but as the address given in the letter
written to Major Tidman, was that of a narrow
street close at hand&mdash;Rupert had looked it up in the
Directory,&mdash;he did not take a cab. On his way along
the streaming pavement he again had the sensation
of being followed, and felt for the revolver, with
which he had very wisely provided himself. But
nothing happened, and he arrived at the mouth of
the narrow street which was called Penter's Alley.
There were few people about, as the ragged loafers
were within, not caring to face the pelting rain in
their light attire. Rupert stepped cautiously down
the side street, and saw in the distance a Chinese
lantern, which he knew, marked the house he was
to enter. This token had been set forth in the
letter.</p>

<p>Just as the young man was half way down, a dark
figure, which had crept up behind him, darted forward
and aimed a blow at him. Rupert dodged and tried
to close: but at that moment another figure dashed
between the two men and delivered a right-hander.
There was a stifled cry of rage and the clash of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
knife on the wet pavement. Then the first assailant
cleared off, and Rupert found himself facing his
rescuer. "Just in time," said Clarence Burgh.</p>

<p>"What, you here," said Rupert surprised. "I left
you at the station."</p>

<p>"I guess that's so, but I followed you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And by what right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's square enough," replied Burgh, "you'd
agreed to work along with me on this racket."</p>

<p>"Not altogether. I had not made up my mind."</p>

<p>"Well I guess you'll make it up now Mr. Ainsleigh.
It was a good job I came after you as I did,
or this would have been into your ribs," and he held
up a long knife which he had picked up.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged," said Ainsleigh, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well if you're obliged, let me go along with you
and see you through this game. I don't know what
it is, but I'm on for larks."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh reflected, and on the impulse of the
moment trusted the man. Clarence had undoubtedly
saved his life, and it would be just as well
to take him. Also Clarence could do no harm, as
Tung-yu and Hwei would see to that. "Very good,"
said Ainsleigh, "come along. I'm going to where
that Chinese lantern is."</p>

<p>Clarence gave a long whistle and smote his leg,
"Gad," said he between his teeth, "you're on the
Chinese racket again."</p>

<p>"Oh, behalf of Major Tidman," and Rupert
rapidly gave details.</p>

<p>Burgh whistled again, "Ho," he laughed, "so
they think Tidman's the strangler. Well I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
not. Forge for my money. Let's heave ahead
Ainsleigh, and see what the Chinkeys have to say."</p>

<p>The two moved on and stopped under the lantern.
A sharp knock at a closed door brought forth a
Chinese boy, who was dressed&mdash;queerly enough&mdash;all
in red. Rupert recalled Tidman's adventure at
Canton, and did not like the look of things. But
Clarence pushed past him and addressed the boy.</p>

<p>"We've come to see Tung-yu," said he, "give
this brat the letter, Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>The boy took the letter and instead of looking at
it by the light of the lantern, smelt it carefully.
Then Ainsleigh remembered that it was strongly perfumed
with some queer scent. Clarence cackled.</p>

<p>"Rummy coves these Chinese beasts," said he
politely.</p>

<p>Evidently the boy was satisfied, for he threw open
the door, and the two adventurers entered. They
passed along a narrow corridor to a second door.
On this being opened, they turned down a long
passage to the right and were conducted by the red
boy into a small room decorated in Chinese fashion,
somewhat after the style of that in Dr. Forge's
house. At the end there was a shrine with a hideous
god set up therein, and before this, smoked some
joss sticks giving out a strange perfume. A tasselled
lantern hung from the ceiling. The chairs and
table, elegant in design were of carved black wood,
and the walls were hung with gaily pictured paper.
The room was neat and clean, but pervaded by that
strange atmosphere of the East which brings back
curious memories to those who have travelled into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
those parts. After conducting them into this room,
the red boy vanished and the men found themselves
alone.</p>

<p>"Well I reckon we're got to make ourselves
comfortable," said the buccaneer sitting, "rum
shanty&mdash;just like an opium den I know of, down
'Frisco way. Ho! I wonder how Tung-yu's escaped
the police?"</p>

<p>"I wonder rather who it was that tried to knife
me," said Rupert sitting.</p>

<p>Clarence looked queer. "We'll talk of that when
we get through with this business. Here's some
fairy."</p>

<p>Even while he spoke a tall lean Chinaman entered
noiselessly. He had a rather fierce face and one eye.
Burgh started up.</p>

<p>"Hwei," said he amazed. "I thought you had
lighted out for 'Frisco."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Fan Mystery</span></h4>


<p>The one-eyed Chinaman did not smile, nor did he
greet Burgh in any way, friendly or otherwise. He
simply looked at the two, with an impassive gaze
and then glanced at a clock, the hands of which
pointed to thirty minutes past eleven. What a
clock should be doing in this Eastern room, the
visitors could not make out. It seemed to be out of
place. Yet there it was, and there was Hwei staring
at it. He still preserved silence and brought his
one eye from the clock to Rupert with a malevolent
glare.</p>

<p>"Major Tidman has not come," said Hwei in
English, as good as that spoken by Tung-yu,
but in a grating voice.</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert who was addressed. "He received
your note,&mdash;or rather Tung-yu's letter,&mdash;and
asked me to come here on his behalf."</p>

<p>"And I guess Hwei," drawled Clarence, "that I
have come to see the business through."</p>

<p>"That will not take long," said the Chinaman
cheerfully, yet with an unpleasant stare, "where is
the fan of the Mandarin?"</p>

<p>"I have not got it," replied Ainsleigh shortly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Major Tidman did not send it perhaps."</p>

<p>"No. For the simple reason that it is not in his
possession."</p>

<p>"That," said Hwei grimly, "is a lie."</p>

<p>"It's the truth," chipped in Burgh suddenly, "old
man Tidman didn't choke that woman!"</p>

<p>"You mean Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>Burgh nodded. "That's so," said he in a curt
way, but with a watchful eye on the one-eyed Chinaman.</p>

<p>Hwei gnawed his long finger nails, and then
slipped his hands inside his long hanging sleeves.
In his dull blue clothes with the clumsy slippers, he
looked taller than ever, and quite as unpleasant as
at first sight. His pig-tail was coiled round his
shaven head. He looked sharply at the two men
with his one eye, and appeared to be thinking, "It's
my day," said he at length.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh and Burgh jumped up. "Do you intend
to murder us?" asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"If you have the fan," rejoined Hwei coldly, "it is
the order of the god Kwang-ho," and he bowed reverentially
to the ugly image.</p>

<p>"What right's that second hand joss to give
orders in a free country, Hwei?" asked Clarence,
"and don't you think, we'll give in without laying you
out."</p>

<p>Hwei made a clicking noise with his tongue and
then smote a small brass gong which hung near the
door. The thunder had scarcely died away before
the door opened and there appeared four or five
villainous looking Chinamen with long knives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Rupert stepped back and stood against the wall, with
his revolver levelled. But Clarence simply produced
the knife he had picked up on the pavement. "I
guess," he said reflectively, "you tried to knife Ainsleigh
outside. The knife here's the same as those
things yonder," and he nodded towards the door.
"Well, sail in. We're ready for the play."</p>

<p>Hwei started at this speech, and chattered something
in Chinese. At once the door closed and the three
were again alone. "I never ordered anyone to be
knifed outside," he said, with his one eye on Clarence,
"that would be foolish. First the fan, then the
death."</p>

<p>"I was certainly attacked outside," said Rupert
lowering his revolver.</p>

<p>"Who attacked you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. But perhaps Burgh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's my business," said the cheerful Clarence
who had taken his seat, and did not seem to be at all
afraid of the dangerous position in which he found
himself, "what we have to do, is to yarn about this
fan. I saw you in 'Frisco, Hwei. I reckoned the
fan was there."</p>

<p>"We thought so, Mr. Burgh, but it came to the
ears of Lo-Keong that it was in England. So then
I came here."</p>

<p>"Ah, I saw you in China also," said Clarence.</p>

<p>"You did, and learned much about the fan&mdash;too
much," growled Hwei.</p>

<p>Rupert who was growing weary of all this hinted
mystery sat down again, and threw the revolver on
the table. "I wish you would make a clean breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of this," he said calmly. "I don't care about the
fan, but I do want to know who killed Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"Major Tidman did."</p>

<p>"No. He was with me on the beach. I went
out to smoke and we strolled up and down till nearly
twelve. He was with me shortly after eleven, so he
could not have killed the woman."</p>

<p>Hwei pointed a long finger at the young man. "I
saw Major Tidman speaking to a boatman on the
beach&mdash;the boat came from the Stormy Petrel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your boat," said Burgh quickly.</p>

<p>"No. The boat of Tung-yu. It was my day, but
Tung-yu hoped to get the fan after twelve at night
and then would have had the right to take it away in
the boat. Major Tidman killed Miss Wharf and gave
the knowledge of his crime to Tung-yu. He would
not part with the fan till the money was paid.
Tung-yu went away in the boat so that the police
might not get him. He was wise," added Hwei with
a queer smile, "as he is accused of the murder."</p>

<p>"Which you committed."</p>

<p>"No I did not. Had I found Miss Wharf outside
I should have killed her. It was my hour, but she
escaped me."</p>

<p>"Then you were in Marport on that night?" asked
Rupert.</p>

<p>Hwei nodded. "Not at the hotel. Tung-yu went
to the ball, and was to bring Miss Wharf out down
the steps, so that I could kill her. I came to the steps
about twelve, and while waiting on the beach I saw
you sir, talking to the Major. But Tung-yu betrayed
me." Hwei's face looked fiercer then ever. "He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
not bring her to me in my hour, and so betrayed the
trust of the god Kwang-ho. He wanted her to live,
so that he might buy the fan next day."</p>

<p>"But so long as he got the fan&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hwei flung out a long arm. "No," said he
austerely, "if Tung-yu gets the fan it goes with its
secret into the hands of Mandarin Hop Sing, who is
the enemy of my master."</p>

<p>"And who is your master?" asked Clarence.</p>

<p>"Lo-Keong. Listen." Hwei took a seat and
talked, with his one eye on the visitors. "The fan
is my master's, and holds a secret which means
much to him. It was lost. We invoked the god
Kwang-ho. By the mouth of his priest the gods
said that two men should search for it. I was
to search for Lo-Keong, and Tung-yu for Hop Sing
the enemy of my master. Hop Sing's emmissary
was to buy the fan at a large price, I was to kill the
person who held it. Thus, said the god, justice
would be done. The person who held the fan would
be rewarded for virtue or slain for evil. One day is
mine and the next day is Tung-yu's. At the ball I had
my hour, and had I found Miss Wharf I would have
slain her for the fan. But Tung-yu betrayed me,
as he wished to buy the fan next day. But the god
Kwang-ho interfered, and the woman who held the
fan wrongfully met with her doom. Great is the
justice of the god Kwang-ho," and he bowed again
to the ugly image which was half veiled by the
curling smoke.</p>

<p>Rupert stared at the man who talked such good
English, yet who used it, to utter such extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
things. He was not acquainted with the Chinese
character, and could not understand the affair. But
on reflection he concluded that the alternate killing
and rewarding was adopted as giving a chance of
treating the person who secured the fan in the way
he or she deserved. "I see what you mean," said
he, "if the person got the fan wrongfully, it would
come into your possession in your way, if rightfully,
it would go to Tung-yu, therefore the holder of the
fan would be rewarded according to his or her deeds."</p>

<p>Hwei bowed. "Great is the wisdom of the god
Kwang-ho," said he.</p>

<p>"Then I guess you're wrong and the god also,"
said Clarence, "old Miss Wharf got the fan squarely
enough from me."</p>

<p>"She had it wrongfully," said Hwei obstinately
"else she would not have been slain."</p>

<p>"Who slew her?" asked Rupert seeing the
uselessness of argument.</p>

<p>"Major Tidman."</p>

<p>"No. I tell you he was on the beach. Tung-yu
killed her."</p>

<p>Hwei shook his head, "Tung-yu dare not," said
he, "the god would slay him if he disobeyed."</p>

<p>"The god didn't slay him when he played low
down on you in keeping Miss Wharf back from your
knife," said Clarence.</p>

<p>"Tung-yu has done penance. He has made
amends. He wrote to Major Tidman telling him to
come here on my night, so that he might meet with
his doom."</p>

<p>"But he hasn't come."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is afraid."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert decisively, "the Major has not
the fan. Who has, I know no more than I do who
killed Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>Hwei wavered, and his keen face grew troubled.
The persistence of Rupert was having its effect.
"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Ainsleigh promptly.</p>

<p>"Will you swear this before the god Kwang-ho."</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;but remember I am a Christian."</p>

<p>Hwei went to the shrine and brought forth a joss
stick. "The god Kwang-ho is all powerful," said
he solemnly, "if you lie, he will not spare you.
Burn this joss before him and swear."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert drawing back. "I am a
Christian."</p>

<p>Hwei's eye flashed with fury. "You are lying,"
said he, "you will never leave this place alive."</p>

<p>"Oh I guess so," said Clarence easily, "neither I
nor Ainsleigh has the fan, and you can't kill either
of us unless the god grows angry. You've got to
climb down before him."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Hwei dropping the joss-stick,
and sat in his chair with a puzzled face. He then
pointed to the clock, the long hand of which was
drawing to twelve. "When that strikes, my hour
is over," he said, "but I may kill you before then."</p>

<p>"You've got ten minutes to do it in," said Burgh
cheerfully, "and Ainsleigh and I intend to fight for
it. You'll be hanged too."</p>

<p>"No," said Hwei. "I'll be on my way to China
with the fan. I have a boat waiting near, to take me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to a special steamer. I intended to kill Major
Tidman, take the fan and go. Then all the police in
the country would not have caught me."</p>

<p>"And your nice little plan has been defeated by
the Major not coming up," said Rupert calmly,
"just as well he didn't. And I have not got the
fan."</p>

<p>"Who has&mdash;who has," said Hwei biting his nails,
and evidently quite at a loss. "I made sure&mdash;" he
looked at Clarence.</p>

<p>"Oh it wasn't me," said that gentleman promptly,
"but I may know who killed the old woman and has
the fan."</p>

<p>Hwei flung himself forward. "Tell&mdash;tell&mdash;tell,"
he grasped, and he laid his long fingers on Burgh's
throat. The young man threw him over with a
great effort and slipped back to the wall, where he
stood beside Rupert. The two had out their revolvers.
"You wait," said Clarence in a breathless voice, for
the struggle though brief had been violent, "tell me
the secret of the fan, and I'll give you the name of
the person who has it."</p>

<p>"What," cried Hwei furiously, "betray my master,
you foreign devil. I will kill you first."</p>

<p>"You've just got five minutes to do it in," cried
Burgh jeeringly.</p>

<p>The Chinaman put his fingers to his lips and
blew a shrill whistle. In a moment the room was
filled with Chinamen, chattering and screaming like
so many infuriated parrots. Hwei threw himself on
the young men. "Die&mdash;Die&mdash;" he said thickly.</p>

<p>"Fire&mdash;fire," cried Clarence, kicking Hwei back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next few minutes Rupert had no very
clear idea of what was happening. He fired into the
mass of Chinamen pushing forward, and heard a cry
as a man dropped. The others fell over him, and in
the struggle upset the shrine. The ugly joss rolled
on to the floor and caught fire. There were shrill
screams from the Chinese, who began to jab with
their knives. Clarence was rolling on the floor in
close grips with Hwei, and the draperies of the joss
flared away in a brilliant manner. It seemed as
though the two rash men would be either burnt or
stabbed, and the end was coming rapidly.</p>

<p>All at once the silvery chime of the clock sounded
and then came the rapid striking of the hour. The
door opened and the boy in red appeared. He said
something in a screaming voice, and then, almost
as by magic, the room emptied. The rolling mass
of Chinamen had extinguished the flaming joss, and
Hwei, suddenly disengaging himself from the buccaneer,
darted through the door. The boy followed
with the rest of the assailants, and when Rupert and
Burgh got their <ins title="reath">breath</ins> they found themselves facing
the still smoking joss, with Tung-yu blandly smiling
at them.</p>

<p>"Ho," said Clarence rising and shaking himself.
"I guess the row's over. Hurt Ainsleigh?"</p>

<p>"Got a flesh wound," said Rupert, winding his
handkerchief round his left arm, "and you?"</p>

<p>"I'm as right as a pie. So here's Tung-yu. Your
hour I guess."</p>

<p>The Chinaman bowed, and picking up the god
restored him to his shrine, which was considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
damaged. "It is lucky the red boy cried that Hwei's
hour was over," he said coolly, "or you would both
have been killed."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have got the fan though," said
Rupert throwing himself down on his seat, "but you
don't intend to kill us I suppose."</p>

<p>"No. The god Kwang-ho is merciful now. I
make you rich."</p>

<p>"Humph," said Burgh crossly, "I wish I had that
fan with me."</p>

<p>"You have, or Mr. Ainsleigh here, has it," said
Tung-yu, "I will give you five thousand for the fan."</p>

<p>"I haven't got it."</p>

<p>"Think&mdash;ten thousand."</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" cried Clarence avariciously, "wish
I could trade."</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand," said Tung-yu his eyes
glittering, "come gentlemen it's better to be rich
than dead. For the next twenty-four hours I can
give you money. Then comes <ins title="Hewi's">Hwei's</ins> hour and he
will kill you."</p>

<p>"Not much," said Burgh, "I'm going to cut."</p>

<p>"You shall be kept here, till you give up the fan."</p>

<p>Rupert shrugged his shoulders. "You won't
believe," he said, "why not search us. Then you
can see we have not the fan. Do you believe that
Major Tidman has it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He gave it to you. He killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He did not. Can you swear that he did?"</p>

<p>"No. But I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh shucks," said Clarence shoving himself forward,
"see here Mr. Tung-yu. I'm sick of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
business. We haven't got that durned fan. But I
can tell you who has."</p>

<p>"Tell then and I give you a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Not good enough," said Burgh coolly, "see here,
you let us go free and tell us the fan's secret, and
I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and get the fan, and learn the secret," cried
Tung-yu excited, "but you cannot make use of the
secret."</p>

<p>"Don't want to. And as to the fan, you can get
it from the person I tell you of. Then you can fork
out fifteen thousand."</p>

<p>The Chinaman deliberated. "We have been
wrong about Major Tidman, I think," said he politely.
"It seems someone else has it. I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't kill the old girl myself if that's what you
mean."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Tung-yu, after another pause.
"Well, as you can't make any use of the secret I'll
tell you of it. Then you can go free, after you have
told me who killed Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"Right oh," said Clarence, and Rupert listened
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The fan," said Tung-yu, "is jade on one side,
and enamel on the other. The enamelled side is
painted with a picture invisibly. To bring out the
picture, this fan has to be waved in certain smoke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What sort of smoke?"</p>

<p>"I won't tell you that," said Tung-yu politely,
"I have told enough."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Rupert, "when the picture is
visible what happens?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will show a hiding place which contains certain
things we want to get, in order to ruin Lo-Keong
with the Empress."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, a plan of a secret hiding-place."</p>

<p>"Now you know," said Tung-yu to Clarence,
"tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not till I know of the smoke."</p>

<p>"I refuse. But I give you fifteen thousand to get
that fan. One thousand now if you tell me who
killed the woman and who has it."</p>

<p>"Good," said Clarence, "I'll trade. Dr. Forge
strangled Miss Wharf."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tung-yu leaping up, "he has the fan.
Thanks Kwang-ho," and he bowed to the half-destroyed
image.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Disappearance</span></h4>


<p>When Rupert returned to Marport next day,
Burgh accompanied him. The young squire of
Royabay wished to give information to the police
regarding the guilt of Forge. But Clarence persuaded
him against doing so. "You'll only get me
into a row," said he, in his candid way. "You see
I told a lie."</p>

<p>"You tell so many lies," said Rupert sharply,
"I don't know but what I ought to give you in
charge."</p>

<p>"I guess not, seeing I saved your life last night."</p>

<p>"No. You're right there Burgh. But have you
really anything to do with this murder?"</p>

<p>"No, 'cept as how I told old Tung-yu last night."</p>

<p>"Just repeat what you said. I was so faint with
the loss of blood that I didn't gather half you said."</p>

<p>Burgh nodded. "You were pretty sick. I'd to
help you back to civilization, same as if you were
drunk. If I hadn't, you'd have been robbed and
killed down that Bowery gangway."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh could not, but acknowledge that
Clarence had acted very well. He had saved him
from the man who attacked him in the street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
also, it was owing to him that the two had escaped
from the gang of Hwei. Finally Burgh had taken
Rupert back to the Guelph Hotel in Jermyn Street,
when he was rather shaky from the wound. It
was much better this morning, but Ainsleigh looked
pale, and not at all himself. Still he did not grudge
the trifling wound&mdash;it was merely a scratch although
it had bled freely,&mdash;as the knowledge he had acquired,
was well worth the trouble. They had left
the den in Penter's Alley, some time after mid-night,
and had returned safely to the West, where Rupert
had acted as host to Burgh. That was Clarence all
over. Whenever he did anyone a service, he always
took it out of him in some way, and but, for the
dangerous position in which he found himself would
have quartered his carcase on Rupert for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p>"But there ain't no denying that I'm in a fix,"
said Burgh, as the train drew near Marport.
"That is, if you split Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"No, I won't split on you. But if Forge is guilty
he must be arrested," said Rupert decisively.</p>

<p>"But I don't know if he strangled the old girl
after all."</p>

<p>"You said he did, last night."</p>

<p>"Well I wanted to know the secret of that fan."</p>

<p>Rupert shrugged his shoulders. "You know
that the fan when waved in a certain smoke&mdash;of
which by the way you learned nothing&mdash;reveals
a hiding place which contains certain things Tung-yu
wants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To ruin Lo-Keong," said Burgh quickly. "So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
I guess if I can pick up that fan from old Forge, I'll
yank in the dollars."</p>

<p>"Aren't you satisfied with what you have."</p>

<p>"This thousand. Oh that's all right. I cashed
the cheque before I joined you at the station&mdash;got it
in gold so I can clear out when it suits me. It's
always as well to be ready to git."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Ainsleigh dryly, "in your varied
career, you have had frequent occasions to 'git' as
you call it."</p>

<p>"You bet. But git's slang American and good
Turkish lingo, so you've no need to sneer old man.
'Say, about Forge. What's to be done?"</p>

<p>"I'll communicate with Rodgers and tell him what
you say. If the doctor is guilty he must suffer."</p>

<p>"My eye," said Clarence reflectively, "won't
aunty be mad. Well I guess this will square us:
she won't play low down on me again."</p>

<p>"Burgh, you're a blackguard."</p>

<p>"I am, that's a fact," said the buccaneer in no
wise disturbed. "But don't you say that in public
or the fur'll fly."</p>

<p>"Pooh. You know I'm equal to you. But this
story&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The one I told Tung-yu last night," grinned
Burgh, "I'll reel it out now, and you can sort it out
as you choose. I believe Forge to be the scragger
of the old girl, because he had that tie of yours."</p>

<p>"How did he get the tie?"</p>

<p>"I gave it to him," confessed Clarence candidly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I remember you said so last night. But I
forget how you explained the getting of it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh," drawled Burgh folding his arms. "You
might call it stealing old pard. Y'see Miss Pewsey&mdash;my
old aunty that is&mdash;saw Olivia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ainsleigh, hang you."</p>

<p>"Right oh," continued Burgh imperturbably.
"Well, aunty saw Mrs. Ainsleigh pass the tie to you,
and when you went to the cloak-room she told me.
I was real mad not knowing how things were, as I
wanted that tie for myself. I'd no notion of your
getting things made by the young lady I was sweet
on."</p>

<p>"I wish you would leave out my wife's name,"
said Rupert angrily, and wincing with pain, for his
wound hurt him not a little.</p>

<p>"I'll try: don't get your hair off. Well I cut
along to the card room&mdash;no t'wasn't the card room&mdash;the
cloak-room, and saw you standing by your coat, just
hanging it up again."</p>

<p>"And you saw me put the tie in the pocket."</p>

<p>"I guess not: but I fancied you might have done
so. Then I waited outside while you yarned with
the Chinese cove and Tidman. After that I cut in
and you know the rest."</p>

<p>"Up to the time I knocked you down. Well?"</p>

<p>"Smashing blow," said Burgh coolly, "you can use
your hands pretty well I reckon&mdash;but a six shooter's
more in my line. Well, when you cut, I lay down
and saw stars for a time. Then I thought I'd pay
you out by annexing the tie."</p>

<p>"You didn't know it was there?"</p>

<p>"Thought it might be," rejoined Burgh coolly,
"anyhow there was no harm in trying. I found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
tie, and went out with it, thinking you be pretty
sick when you found it gone. I went into the card-room
where old Forge was cheating I guess, and had
a yarn along o'him. He just roared when I showed
him the tie, for he hates you like pie."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Rupert sharply, "you are
mistaken."</p>

<p>"I guess not. That old man would have been
glad to see you scragged, Mr. Ainsleigh. He asked
me to let him have the tie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>Burgh shrugged his shoulders. "He didn't say.
But I let him have it anyhow. I wasn't in a position
to refuse. Y'see Ainsleigh I'm not a holy Bill
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Forge knows a few of your escapades likely
to land you in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Y'needn't say the word," interrupted Burgh in
his turn, "t'isn't a pretty one. But I guess Forge
could make things hot for me if he liked, so
that was why I lay low when I saw the tie round
the old girl's throat. I guessed then, Forge had
scragged her and boned the fan. I asked him about
it, and he lied like billeo. Said he'd lost the tie, and
never touched the old 'un. Then he said if I made
any fuss, he'd tell the police about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About what?" asked Ainsleigh, seeing the man
hesitate.</p>

<p>"Huh," replied Burgh, uncomfortably, "I guess
that's my business. I told you I wasn't a saint."</p>

<p>"I suspect you're a thorough paced gaol-bird."</p>

<p>"No, I ain't been in quod. Where I <ins title="gavorted">cavorted</ins><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
round, in the Naked Lands, they don't shove a man
in chokey for every trifle."</p>

<p>"Such as murder. Eh?"</p>

<p>"I haven't murdered anyone yet," confessed
Clarence, easily, "but one never knows. But I
told about Forge last night, as I wanted to get this
thousand. Now I'll try for the fan, and see if I
can't get the fifteen thousand to come my way. If
Forge cuts up rough, I'll light out with what I
have"&mdash;he slapped his pockets&mdash;"for Callao," and
he began to sing the old song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On no occasion, is extradition,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Allowed in Callao."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And I know a daisy of a girl out there," said the
scamp, winking.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh was too disgusted to speak. He felt
that as he was as big a ruffian as Burgh, to tolerate
this conversation, and he was relieved when the
train steamed into Marport station. As soon as it
stopped he jumped out, and nodding to his companion,
he was about to take his leave, when
Clarence stopped him. "Say. You won't round on
Forge till I get this fan business settled."</p>

<p>"I intend to write to Rodgers to-day," said Ainsleigh,
tartly, "bad as your aunt is, she shan't marry
that scoundrel if I can help it."</p>

<p>"But I only know Forge got the scarf as I told
you. He mightn't have scragged her y'know. He
says he didn't."</p>

<p>"And relied on what he knows of you to keep
things quiet. No, Mr. Burgh, I intend to have the
man arrested," and Rupert turned away, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Clarence, apparently not at all disturbed, went
away whistling his Callao ditty.</p>

<p>Rupert drove to Royabay and was welcomed with
joy by his wife. She was much alarmed when she
saw his condition, and was very angry when he told of
his danger. She made him lie down, and bathed
the wound, of which Rupert made light. "It's
nothing, dear," he said.</p>

<p>"It might be dangerous. There might have been
poison on that knife, Rupert. You know what the
Chinese are."</p>

<p>"No, Olivia, I certainly don't. All this business
of the fan and the god Kwang-ho is most ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," said Olivia, when she had
placed a tray, with tea and toast, before him.</p>

<p>"I shall do so at once, as I want your advice,"
and Rupert related all that had occurred from the
time of his meeting with Clarence Burgh in the train
on the previous night. Olivia listened in silence.
"Well," asked Rupert, drinking his tea, "what do
you think?"</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Burgh is a scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Anyone can see that!"</p>

<p>"And worthy of his aunt."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. She's a bad one that Miss Pewsey,
but she may not know what a rascal she has for a
relative. And at all events, I can't let her marry
Forge. Do you believe he is guilty?"</p>

<p>"He might be," said Olivia cautiously, "but I
would much rather believe that Burgh gave the tie
<ins title="o">to</ins> his aunt and that she strangled aunt Sophia."</p>

<p>Rupert laughed. "What a vindictive person you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
are dearest," said he. "Miss Pewsey is bad but
not so bad as that."</p>

<p>"I'd credit her with anything," said Olivia, who
was truly feminine in her detestation of Miss <ins title="Pewsy">Pewsey</ins>.
"She has insulted me for years, and put aunt Sophia
against me, and caused me to lose the money."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well," said Rupert soothingly, "let us
think the best of her&mdash;she has her good points."</p>

<p>"Where are they&mdash;what are they? She is a&mdash;no,"
Olivia checked herself and looked penitent, "I
really must not give way to such unworthy feelings.
I'll try and think the best of her, and I agree with
you darling, that she must not marry Dr. Forge."</p>

<p>"Do you think I should write to Rodgers?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. The marriage must be stopped.
Write to-day."</p>

<p>But Rupert did not write that day, for the simple
reason that the wound on his arm grew very painful,
and he became delirious. The doctor who was
called in, said that there was poison in the blood and
then Olivia was alarmed lest Rupert should lose his
arm, and perhaps his life. However, the doctor was
young and clever and by careful treatment he drew
out the poison and in a few days, the young man's
arm had resumed its normal condition, and his
brain again became clear. Then he wrote a letter
to Rodgers asking him to come down to Royabay on
a matter connected with the murder of his wife's
aunt. After the letter had been posted, Rupert
went out for a walk with his wife, and strolled round
the grounds. As the two crossed the lawn admiring
the beauty of the day which was bright and clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and slightly frosty, Mrs. Petley appeared, coming
up the avenue. She made straight for the young
couple.</p>

<p>"Please Master Rupert, that gent's called again."</p>

<p>"What, Mr. Burgh?" said Olivia, and then in
answer to her husband's enquiring look she explained.
"He has called for the last three days, dear,
since you were ill. I never told you, as I thought
it might worry you."</p>

<p>"And he just called to ask how you were, Master
Rupert," said the old housekeeper, "and never
come nearer than the lodge, as old Payne can
testify. I told him you were out walking and he
asked if he could come in and see you."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Rupert&mdash;then, when Mrs. Petley
hurried away, he turned to Olivia. "Burgh simply
wants to find out if I have communicated with
Rodgers. He's frightened for his own skin."</p>

<p>Shortly Mrs. Petley returned with the information
that Mr. Burgh was nowhere to be seen. This did
not trouble Rupert who thought that the buccaneer
(always of an impatient disposition) might have grown
tired of waiting. With Olivia, he strolled round the
grounds for thirty minutes and at length entered the
ruins of the Abbey. Here the first thing they saw,
was Mr. Clarence Burgh seated on a stone under
the copper beech. He jumped up and came forward,
with his usual grace and invariable impudence.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you out again, Ainsleigh," said he
taking off his hat, "and you look well, Mrs. Ainsleigh&mdash;just
like a picture."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Olivia, concealing her dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>like
with difficulty, "you wish to see my husband I
presume."</p>

<p>"Just for two shakes," said Clarence easily, "say
old man, what about Forge. Are y' going to round
on him?"</p>

<p>Rupert nodded, "I have written to Rodgers to-day.
But I'll give him this chance of escape&mdash;warn
him if you like."</p>

<p>"Not me," said Burgh coldly, "every man for
his own durned skin&mdash;begging your pardon Mrs.
Ainsleigh. I saw him while you were trying for
Kingdom Come, and told him that he'd the
fan."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Gave me the lie. Swore he'd been in the card-room
between eleven and twelve, and never saw the
old girl. Said he'd had enough of the fan, as it had
nearly caused his death. Then he said he'd split on
me if I gave him away."</p>

<p>"But you told him, you did confess to the Chinaman."</p>

<p>"Oh that's all right. Forge don't care a red cent
for their telling the police. They won't engineer
the biznai into the courts. So long as they get the
fan, they don't mind. Forge knows they won't
make the matter public, but now he's in mortal
fear, lest they should kill him."</p>

<p>"Thinking he's got the fan."</p>

<p>"You bet&mdash;on my evidence. Well," said Burgh
calmly and with a twinkle in his evil eyes. "I
reckon old man Forge is in an almighty fix. He's
in danger of being knifed by Hwei&mdash;thanks to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and of being hanged for killing the old girl&mdash;thanks
to you."</p>

<p>Olivia's face expressed her disgust. "If you have
heard all you wish to hear, we'll go away," she said
to her husband.</p>

<p>"Right oh," said Burgh. "Don't mind me. Pretty
place y'have here," he added looking round the
beautiful cloisters, "that's the place where they
lynched the old monk I reckon. I've heard that
silly rhyme of yours, Ainsleigh. I guess you've
fulfilled one part."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Rupert stiffly.</p>

<p>"About the marriage y'know. A poor Ainsleigh
has wedded a poor wife. So that's all right. Now
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must be going," interrupted Ainsleigh annoyed
by the man's glib talk, "have you anything else to
say?"</p>

<p>"Only this. Forge is going to hitch long-side
Aunt Lavinia to-morrow, and if you run him in,
she'll get left."</p>

<p>"All the better for her," said Ainsleigh calmly,
"he's a bad lot."</p>

<p>"That's so. Much worse than you think. He
was the man who tried to stab you in Penter's
Alley."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He was though. I saw his face under the lamp,
as he let fly. Then he cut and&mdash;you know the
rest. But I'm off. My eye," Clarence chuckled,
"what a shine there'll be to-morrow, when Aunty
gets left."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Burgh strolled away whistling, and Olivia expressed
her disgust at his free and easy manners. Rupert,
reflecting on what Clarence had told him of Forge's
assault, resolved to be a fair and open enemy. He
decided to call on Forge and tell him that he had
written to Rodgers. Also, he desired to ask why he
attempted the second crime. Olivia approved, so
Rupert went early next day to Tidman's Avenue.
The door was opened by Mrs. Bressy who was
wiping her mouth as though she had just been at the
bottle, which was probably the case. In reply to
Rupert's enquiry for her master, she told him that
Dr. Forge had gone. "He went to Londing, sir&mdash;larst
night," said Mrs. Bressy.</p>

<p>"Did he leave any address?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Ainsleigh, he did not."</p>

<p>The inference was easy. Forge had bolted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a><ins title="CHAPTER XVII">CHAPTER XVIII</ins></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Surprise</span></h4>


<p>Rupert was much disappointed that Forge had not
been arrested. Apart from the fact that he thought
the old scoundrel should suffer for his dastardly crime
in killing an inoffensive woman, he wished to learn
what Forge could reveal of his father's death. The
explanation already given, did not satisfy him, and
he suspected that the doctor knew more than he
chose to admit. But under pressure, and standing
in danger of his life, he might be induced to be more
explicit. But, as the man, apparently warned by
Clarence, had disappeared, there was no more to be
said. And Forge had taken a large trunk, and all
his loose cash, so there was no doubt that he intended
to keep away from Marport.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh, much disgusted, went to seek Clarence
Burgh at the Bristol Hotel, but learned, that he also,
had gone away. Much perplexed the young man
sought out Major Tidman, and laid the case before
him. The Major was much astonished at the recital,
and very angry to learn that Hwei and Tung-yu
suspected him of the murder. "But I guessed they
did, from the fact of that letter asking after the fan,"
said Tidman, pacing his room, much agitated. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
hope Ainsleigh, they don't think I have it now, or my
life will not be worth a moment's purchase."</p>

<p>"No. You needn't worry. Burgh has fully convinced
them, that Forge has the fan."</p>

<p>"Then they'll make for him."</p>

<p>"No doubt, and perhaps that is why Forge cleared
out. But I don't understand why our friend Burgh
should make himself scarce."</p>

<p>"I do," said Tidman sitting down and wiping his
bald forehead, "he isn't a man with a clean past, and
Forge knows about it. It's just on the cards that,
to revenge himself on Burgh for having told Hwei
about the fan, Forge has written to the police
giving an account of Master Clarence's delinquency."</p>

<p>"But, on the other hand, if Burgh warned Forge
that I had written to Rodgers, the doctor might
forgive him."</p>

<p>"Not he. Forge is a bitter hater, and after all,
Clarence would only be trying to right, what he
had put wrong. If he'd held his tongue about the
fan and the murder, there would be no need for
Forge to cut. As it is, I believe the doctor will make
it hot for our mutual friend."</p>

<p>"When did you see Burgh last?"</p>

<p>"At dinner last night. He said nothing about
going away, and I quite believed he would stop on.
He's in good quarters here and Miss Pewsey is paying
the bill. But he took a small bag with him,
saying he was going up town for a few days, and
left by the nine evening train."</p>

<p>"Ah! He may come back after all."</p>

<p>"He may: but I doubt it. He doesn't want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
face an inquiry. You see he gave the tie to Forge
and said nothing about it at the inquest, so that
makes him an accessory after the fact."</p>

<p>"But Burgh didn't know Forge's game."</p>

<p>"No. All the same he should have spoken out at
the inquest. Well, and what is to be done now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'm sick of the whole business. But
Forge told me that this Mandarin, Lo-Keong, holds
eight thousand pounds belonging to my father. I
intend to write for it."</p>

<p>Tidman looked doubtful. "I don't think you'll
get it," said he, "unless you produce the fan."</p>

<p>"Oh! I expect Forge has taken that away with
him."</p>

<p>"Well then, Tung-yu and Hwei will be on his
track, and I shouldn't give much for his life."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit. He may get the money from
Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"If he chances on Tung-yu's day. Queer start
that," added the Major musingly, "the red boy appeared
when I just had my big toe cut off and saved
my life. It happened, much the same with you, and
Hwei lost his power, as he was getting ready to kill
you. I wonder these two scoundrels obey the god so
slavishly."</p>

<p>"Oh, they are both afraid of the god," said Rupert,
rising to take his leave, "but I must get home.
There's nothing more to be discussed."</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the Major chuckling, "unless it
is about that old cat's disappointment. I'll go up to
St. Peter's church and see how she takes it."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Ainsleigh lingering at the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
"it's her wedding day. I expect she knows by this
time, that Forge has cut."</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the Major cruelly. "I wouldn't
lose the fun for something."</p>

<p>Rupert didn't agree with his callous view of the
case, as Miss Pewsey was a woman after all, although
a bad one; and it would be hard that she should
suffer, what she would certainly regard as a public
disgrace. So Rupert avoided St. Peter's Church,
and went home again. Here he found Olivia with a
letter.</p>

<p>"This arrived by the early post," she explained,
"but you went out so quickly, that I could not give
it to you. Just look at it Rupert, such beautiful
writing."</p>

<p>"A foreigner's evidently," said her husband, looking
at the really elegant <ins title="caligraphy">calligraphy</ins>. "They take more
care than we do of their pot-hook and hangers.
Olivia." He started.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Rupert put the envelope under her nose. "Smell
it. Don't you recognise the scent."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Ainsleigh, "it's a strange scent."</p>

<p>"Very, and was used to <ins title="prefume">perfume</ins> the letter which
Tung-yu sent to Major Tidman. This may have to
do with the fan again."</p>

<p>Olivia looked nervous. "I wish we could hear the
last of it," she said. "It has caused enough trouble
already. Open the letter, dear."</p>

<p>Rupert did so and was more astonished than ever.
"Here's an unexpected development," he remarked
passing the letter to Olivia, "Lo-Keong is in England."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ainsleigh read the few lines which stated that
the mandarin was stopping at a fashionable hotel in
Northumberland Avenue, and would do himself the
honour of calling on the son of his old friend in a few
days. "He's come to see after the fan personally,"
said Olivia returning the letter. "I am glad."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Rupert quickly. "I'll now learn
the truth about my father, and see if I can't get that
eight thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Rupert, do you think Lo-Keong killed your
father?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. Forge declared over and over again,
that he died of dysentery, and that Lo-Keong seized
the money for the Boxers. But I'll demand an explanation
from the Mandarin."</p>

<p>"Will he give it?" asked Mrs. Ainsleigh doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He'll have to," replied Rupert grimly, "and he'll
have to give the money back also. I don't care for
Forge's cash, as a villain such as he is, doesn't deserve
any reward. But I want my own eight thousand,
and I'll have it."</p>

<p>"I hope so," sighed Olivia, "we could then pay
off Miss Pewsey, or rather Mrs. Forge, as she no
doubt is by this time."</p>

<p>"No. Forge has bolted."</p>

<p>"What, on the eve of the wedding?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He cleared out last night. Either he
fears being arrested for the murder of your aunt, or
he dreads lest Hwei should come down to kill him
for the sake of the fan. At all events he has gone,
and Miss Pewsey is no doubt waiting at the altar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
St. Peter's Church, for a bridegroom who will never
come. But we must attend to our own troubles,
dear. I'll write to the Mandarin to-day and ask him
to visit us when it suits him. Or else I can run
up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Olivia in a voice of alarm. "I
won't have you go away again, until this fan business
is settled. I'm always afraid of your falling into the
hands of these Chinamen. I shall ask Mr. Lo-Keong,
to stop them searching for the fan."</p>

<p>"He can stop Hwei," said Rupert rising, "but
Tung-yu is in the employment of Hop Sing, the
Mandarin's rival. Don't be afraid, my dearest, I
have been protected by Providence these many
days, and it is not likely that I'll come to grief.
But I fear for Forge and for Burgh, who has
likewise bolted. Those two will certainly get into
trouble."</p>

<p>"It is wrong to say so," said Mrs. Ainsleigh with
a sigh, "but I <i>do</i> dislike that man Burgh, and Dr.
Forge also."</p>

<p>"Leave them in God's hands, dear," replied her
husband gravely, "if they have sinned, they will be
punished. What we have to do, is to learn if Lo-Keong
will restore this money. I'll write, asking
him to come down to Royabay," and Rupert went
to the library forthwith.</p>

<p>It was an autumnal day with a promise of rain.
Ragged clouds drifted across a cold blue sky, and
the wind was rather high. Already many trees had
shed their leaves, but the pine boughs still bore
their sombre burdens. Everything looked old and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
miserable, and there seemed to lurk a premonition
of evil in the air. At least, Olivia thought so, as
she stood at the drawing-room window, looking out
on to the terrace and down the avenue, which could
be seen from this point of view. Rupert was in the
library engaged on his letter to the Mandarin, and
Olivia was half inclined to join him. She felt
weary, chilly and out of spirits, and could not account
for doing so.</p>

<p>"I'm the happiest girl in the world," she assured
herself, "I have married the man I love, and he
adores me. He rescued me from a miserable life,
and is making me immensely happy. I should
certainly be in the best of spirits, yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short at this point and her eyes became
fixed, while a colour flushed her somewhat
pale cheeks. And no wonder. Up the avenue,
battling against the force of the wind, came Miss
Pewsey. She wore a bridal dress of white, a lace
bonnet trimmed with orange blossoms, and carried
a bouquet of flowers. To see this figure in such a
dress walking under a sombre sky, between dripping
trees, and with the winds blowing furiously against
it, was a strange sight, and gave Olivia what the
Scotch call "a grue." Then she became indignant.
It was insolent, she thought, that this woman who
had insulted her so often, who had made her life
miserable, who had robbed her of her inheritance
and who had tried to defame her character, should
thus present herself. On the impulse of the moment
and in spite of wind, and of the rain, which was
beginning to fall, Mrs. Ainsleigh threw open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
French window and stepped out on to the terrace.
It was in her mind, to order Miss Pewsey away.
She deserved little mercy at Olivia's hands.</p>

<p>The noise made by the opening of the window
made Miss Pewsey raise her head, and then she
came straight across the grass. As she drew near,
Olivia was struck with the tragic horror of her face.
She was always old in her looks, but now she
seemed at least a hundred. Her lips were white,
her eyes red and with dark circles under them; a
myriad wrinkles ploughed her face, and her usually
bright eyes were dim and blood-shot. To see this
weird face under the bridal bonnet was at once
grotesque and pathetic. Without a word, Miss
Pewsey climbed the steps gasping at every step, and
came directly towards Olivia. She passed her and
entered the room. Mrs. Ainsleigh came after in a
whirlwind of passion.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded, "this is
<i>my</i> house."</p>

<p>"I am aware of the fact," said Miss Pewsey
dropping into a chair and shaking out her soiled
and sodden bridal dress, "but it may be mine before
the end of the year. But don't let us quarrel," she
went on in a piteous way, "I'm in trouble."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Olivia, who could guess.</p>

<p>"Theophilus has left me. Yes! Last night he
went away leaving a cold letter behind him which
was to be delivered to me at the altar. And it was,"
wept Miss Pewsey, "that old woman Mrs. Bressy
brought the note. It said that Theophilus has left
me for ever. And all my friends were there, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
was awaiting the happy hour, then&mdash;then"&mdash;she
broke down sobbing.</p>

<p>Olivia was touched. Miss Pewsey had always
been her enemy, yet there was something about the
unhappy creature which called for sympathy.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for your trouble," said Mrs. Ainsleigh,
in a softer voice.</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Pewsey drying her eyes with a
very wet handkerchief, "you can't be, I never liked
you, nor you me."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly true, and you turned my aunt
against me. All the same I <i>am</i> sorry, and anything
I can do shall be done."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey threw herself on her knees before
her enemy, who was thus heaping coals of fire on
her head. "Then ask your husband to leave my
Theophilus alone," she whispered. "Clarence, who
has also gone, wrote to me, and said that Mr. Ainsleigh
accused Theophilus of the death of my dearest
Sophia."</p>

<p>"What," cried Olivia, "does Mr. Burgh dare.
Why he accuses Dr. Forge, himself. Rupert
certainly wrote to the detective Mr. Rodgers, but
Mr. Burgh has to substantiate his statement."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey jumped up. "What," she said,
much more her own evil self, "did Clarence accuse
my Theophilus? It's a lie&mdash;a lie. I have kept
silence too long&mdash;much too long."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About the murder," screamed Miss Pewsey, "it
was Clarence who killed my Sophia&mdash;yes&mdash;you may
look and look Olivia&mdash;but it was Clarence himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
He took the tie from the coat-pocket. I told him,
you had given it to him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he gave it to Dr. Forge."</p>

<p>"He did not. Clarence took Sophia out on to the
steps&mdash;at least he appointed to meet her there, to tell
her about the fan. Then he strangled her, thinking
your husband would be accused. Theophilus came
on Clarence when he was picking up the fan.
Sophia held it in her death grip, and it was some
time before he could get it loose. Theophilus came,
and hearing steps, Clarence ran away down to the
beach. Then he returned to the ball-room by the
front of the hotel."</p>

<p>"But the fan?"</p>

<p>"Theophilus Forge has it," said Miss Pewsey, setting
her face, "and I expect he has taken it with him."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell this at the inquest."</p>

<p>"Because I didn't. Clarence is my own sister's
son. I could not see him hanged. He had to hold
his tongue, although he wanted the fan back again.
But I insisted that Theophilus should make the
money out of it. This is Clarence's revenge.
Because the fan is kept from him he threatens
Theophilus; oh Olivia, <i>do</i> ask your husband to leave
the matter alone. I will give up that mortgage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can do nothing," said Olivia, "it isn't in my
husband's power. He has written to Rodgers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he has not told him anything," said Miss
Pewsey eagerly.</p>

<p>"No. He merely asked him to call."</p>

<p>"Then he shall see <i>me</i>, and I'll tell him of
Clarence's wickedness. But the fan&mdash;the fan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>&mdash;we'll
get the money and Theophilus will come back
to be loved and respected. I don't love him, but I
see we can make a lot of money together. The fan,"
said Miss Pewsey counting on her lean fingers, "the
money from Lo-Keong&mdash;the money of Sophia and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Olivia in disgust, "go away you
miserable creature, and think of the hereafter."</p>

<p>Miss Pewsey gave a shrill laugh. "You can't
help me, and your husband can't help me, so I'll go.
But when I come back here, it shall be as mistress.
I hate you Olivia&mdash;I have always hated you&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;oh
you"&mdash;she could utter no more, but gasping,
shook her fist and ran out of the window and down
the avenue with an activity surprising in a woman
of her years.</p>

<p>After dinner and while they were seated in the
library, Olivia told Rupert of Miss Pewsey's visit
and accusation. He declined to believe the tale.
"If Burgh was guilty he wouldn't have brought an
accusation against Forge," he said, "as the doctor,
if this is true, knows the truth. And Forge, if
innocent, would not have cleared&mdash;"</p>

<p>While Ainsleigh was thus explaining, the door
was burst open and Mrs. Petley, white as chalk,
rushed in. "The ghost&mdash;the ghost," said she
dropping into a chair, "the monk&mdash;in the Abbey."</p>

<p>Anxious to learn if there was any truth in these
frequent apparitions reported by Mrs. Petley, Rupert
left the swooning woman to the care of his wife and
departed hastily from the room. Calling old Petley,
he went out of the front door across the lawn and
into the cloisters. Petley, hobbled almost on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
heels with a lantern. The young man stopped
at the entrance to the cloisters, and listened. It
was raining hard and the ground was sopping wet.
But beyond the drip of the rain, and the sighing
of the trees, no sound could be heard. Snatching
the lantern from Petley, Rupert advanced boldly
into the open, and swung the light <ins title="too">to</ins> and fro and
round about. He could see no ghost, nor any dark
figure suggestive of Abbot Raoul.</p>

<p>"Try the black square," piped the feeble voice
of Petley, behind.</p>

<p>With a shrug Rupert did so. He thought that
the housekeeper was mistaken as usual, and that the
ghost was the outcome of her too vivid imagination.
Walking deliberately to the black square where
Abbot Raoul had been burnt three hundred years
before, he swung the light over its bare surface. In
the centre he saw something sparkle, and stooped.
Then he rose with a cry. It was a fan. Rupert
picked it up, opened it, and looked at it in the
lantern light. There were the four beads and half a
bead and the green jade leaves. The very fan itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Visitor</span></h4>


<p>How came the fan there&mdash;and on the accursed
square of ground where no grass would grow?
Rupert was not superstitious, yet his heart gave a
bound, and for the moment he felt sick. This fan
was the cause of much trouble in the past, it had
cost one woman her life, and it might yet claim
another victim. With the fan in his hand, and the
yellow light of the guttering candle in the lantern
gleaming on its beauty, he stood stupidly staring,
unheeding the feeble piping of Petley's voice, as he
peered in at the ruined archway.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Master Rupert?" questioned
the old butler with a shiver, "have you seen
<i>It</i>?"</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert at length, and he hardly knew
his own voice so heavy and thick it was, "there's
nothing to be seen."</p>

<p>A cry came from the old man. "Don't stand on
that accursed ground, Master Rupert," he said, almost
whimpering, "and to-night, of all times."</p>

<p>"Why to-night," said Rupert, retreating back to
the arch.</p>

<p>"Any night," shivered Petley putting his hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
his young master's arm and drawing him out of the
cloisters, "it's not a good place for an Ainsleigh to
be in at night. The Abbot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John, I don't believe in the Abbot."</p>

<p>"But Anne saw him&mdash;or It. She's not the one
to tell a lie."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Petley is deceived in some way." Rupert
considered a moment, and thrust the fan into his
pocket. In the darkness, and because he turned
aside the lantern light, old Petley had not seen that
anything had been picked up. "I'm going to search
round," said Rupert.</p>

<p>The butler gave a long wail as Ainsleigh broke
from his grasp. "No! no!" he cried, lifting his
long hands, "not at night."</p>

<p>But Rupert, now quite himself, did not heed the
superstitious cry. He disbelieved in ghosts more
than ever. Some flesh and blood person had
brought the fan, and recollecting Burgh's story, and
what Olivia had reported of Miss Pewsey's talk that
afternoon, he quite expected to find Dr. Forge lurking
in the cloisters. He would search for him, and
when face to face, he would demand an explanation.
So Rupert swiftly and lightly, walked round, holding
the light high and low in the hope of discovering
some crouching form. And all the time Petley
waited, trembling at the door.</p>

<p>The rain fell softly and there was a gentle wind
swinging the heavy boughs of the pines, so that a
murmurous sound echoed through the cloisters like
the breaking of league-long waves on a pebbly beach.
For at least half an hour Rupert searched: but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
could see no one: he could not even find the impression
of feet, sodden as was the ground. After
looking everywhere within the cloister, and in the
Abbey itself, he brushed past the old butler and
walked down the avenue. Here also, he was at fault
as he could see no one. The gates were closed: but
there was a light in the small house near at hand.
Ainsleigh knocked at the door, and shortly old
Payne, holding a candle, above his head, appeared,
expressing surprise.</p>

<p>"Has anyone entered the gates to-night?" asked
his master.</p>

<p>"No sir. I closed them at five as usual. No one
has come in."</p>

<p>There were no signs of the gates having been
climbed, and the wall which ran round the estate
was so high and the top was pricked with such cruel
spikes, that no one could possibly have entered that
way. Old Payne insisted that no one had entered:
he had heard no voices, no footsteps, and seemed
much perplexed by the insistence of his young master.
At length Rupert desisted from making inquiries,
being perfectly assured that he would learn nothing.
He returned up the avenue slowly to the mansion,
wondering how it came about, that Forge had entered
the ground and left the fan on the very spot where
Abbot Raoul had been burnt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Petley had recovered from her swoon and,
with her husband, had retreated to the kitchen. So,
Rupert learned from Olivia, and he then gave her a
description of his finding of the fan. She was very
amazed and curious. "Show it to me," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not just now, dear," replied Rupert walking to
the door. "I must ask Mrs. Petley first to explain
what she saw."</p>

<p>"She declares it was Abbot Raoul."</p>

<p>"Pooh. Forge masquerading as the monk I
expect. Though why he should come here and
bring this infernal fan I cannot understand. What
is the time, Olivia?"</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock," she replied, "we had dinner early."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, I'll see Mrs. Petley. You need not
say anything about the fan, and as old John didn't
see me pick it up, there will be no difficulty with
him."</p>

<p>"Why should there be any difficulty with him?"
asked Mrs. Ainsleigh.</p>

<p>"Your aunt was killed for the sake of the fan, and
the person who killed her must have been within
these grounds to-night. I want to keep the matter
quiet, until I see Rodgers to-morrow. Then I'll
explain all, and place the fan in his hands."</p>

<p>"Then you think Dr. Forge has been here?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or Clarence Burgh. But, as they have left
Marport, I don't see what they have to gain by
remaining in a place fraught with so much danger
to both."</p>

<p>"They can't both be guilty, Rupert."</p>

<p>"No. But Burgh declares that Forge strangled
your aunt, and Miss Pewsey lays the blame on her
nephew. But I don't believe either one of them. I
shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that the assassin
is Major Tidman after all. He wanted the fan badly,
so as to get the money."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you were with him on the beach, between
eleven and twelve."</p>

<p>"I was, and the evidence of Dr. Forge went to
show that Miss Wharf was killed between those
hours. But suppose, Olivia," Rupert sank his voice
and drew nearer. "Suppose Forge knew from the
condition of the body that your aunt had been
killed <i>before</i> eleven, and had procured the fan from
Tidman by threatening to say so, in which case the
Major could not have proved an alibi."</p>

<p>"It might be so," replied Mrs. Ainsleigh, "but
then the body would have been found earlier."</p>

<p>"No. There was not a single person, so far as I
know, who went down those steps. Tung-yu
certainly did,&mdash;but that was after the crime was
committed, and we know he did not carry the fan
with him. It is a very strange case. Perhaps after
all, Tidman had already killed the woman when he
joined me on the beach to smoke."</p>

<p>"Oh Rupert, how horrid. Was he disturbed?"</p>

<p>"He certainly seemed rather alarmed but I put
that down to the circumstances. He never shook
off his fear of that adventure he had in Canton, and
of course the mere presence of Chinamen would
make him uneasy. But he kept his own council.
However, we can talk of this later. I must see Mrs.
Petley," and Rupert disappeared.</p>

<p>The housekeeper stuck to her story. She had
gone into the cloisters to gather mushrooms which
grew therein, and had the lantern with her. While
stooping at the archway to see what she could pick
she heard, even through the moaning of the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the swish of a long garment. The sound brought
her to her feet, and&mdash;as she phrased it&mdash;with her
heart in her mouth. The place was uncanny and
she had seen the Abbot before. "But never so plain&mdash;oh
never so plain," wailed Mrs. Petley, throwing her
apron over her white hair and rocking. "I held the
light over my head and dropped it with a screech,
for, there, not a yard away, Master Rupert, I saw it,
with a long gown and a hood over its wicked white
face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see the face?"</p>

<p>"I did, just as I dropped the lantern. White and
wicked and evil. I dropped on my knees and said a
prayer with closed eyes and then it went. I took
the lantern and ran for the house for dear life, till I
burst in on you and the mistress. Oh, Master
Rupert dear, what did you see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! And I believe, Mrs. Petley, you beheld
some rascal masquerading."</p>

<p>"No! No! T'was a ghost&mdash;oh dreary me, my
days are numbered."</p>

<p>Mrs. Petley could not be persuaded that the thing
she saw was flesh and blood, so Rupert gave up
trying to convince her. He returned the lantern back
to old John and told the couple to retire to bed.
They were both white and nervous and not fit to be
up. Then he came back to the drawing-room and
found Olivia seated by the fire reading. At the door
Rupert paused to think what a pretty picture she
made in her rich dinner-dress&mdash;one of Miss Wharf's
gifts&mdash;and with one small hand supporting her dainty
head. She looked up, as though she felt the magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of his gaze, and he approached swiftly to press a kiss
on the hand she held out to him. "Well?" asked
Olivia.</p>

<p>Rupert shrugged his shoulders. "There's nothing
to be learned," said he, "Mrs. Petley won't give in.
She believes she has seen a ghost, and <ins title="declines">declares</ins> that
her days are numbered. As she is nearly seventy,
I daresay they are. But this fan,"&mdash;he took it out
of his pocket.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Olivia stretching out her hand.</p>

<p>But Rupert drew it away and spread out the
leaves. "No, my dear, I don't like you to handle
the horrible thing. And besides, you have seen it
often enough in the hand of your aunt."</p>

<p>"Yes, but now there is an awful significance
about it."</p>

<p>"There's blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blood," cried his wife shuddering, "but she was
strangled."</p>

<p>"I speak figuratively, my dear. This little trifle
has cost one life: it may cost more. I am quite
sure Lo-Keong's life hangs on this fan, or he would
not be so anxious to get it back. It has a secret,
and I intend to learn what the secret is."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean to wave it in the smoke," said
Olivia remembering what Rupert had told her of
Tung-yu's speech.</p>

<p>"Yes I do. I want to see the invisible picture.
Then, we may learn of this hiding place which
contains the things, Lo-Keong's enemies wish to
secure. I expect it is some treasonous correspondence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Rupert, the hiding-place will be in China.
Lo-Keong would not send papers of that kind to be
concealed in England."</p>

<p>"It would be the safest place," replied Rupert
dryly, "however, I intend to try the experiment of
waving this fan in the smoke."</p>

<p>"You don't know the kind of smoke?"</p>

<p>"I can guess the kind. Olivia do you remember
that joss stick which Mrs. Petley found in the
Abbey."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at the time she saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Precisely. The ghost left that joss-stick behind
on the first occasion, and the fan on the second.
Now I shouldn't wonder if the fan had got into the
hands of Hwei, and that <i>he</i> was the ghost."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Well, Hwei confessed that he was lurking outside
the Bristol hotel to get a chance of killing Miss
Wharf when she was lured out by Tung-yu. That
gentleman however played false. All the same
Hwei was here, and perhaps he came up to the
Abbey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Olivia looking perplexed.</p>

<p>"Ah, that I can't tell you. But I fancy the
answer is to be found in this fan, as soon as we see
the picture."</p>

<p>"But the smoke."</p>

<p>"Must be made by that joss-stick. It smells like
cinnamon, and is apparently a manufactured article.
Hwei brought it, so that he could wave the fan in
its smoke and then learn the secret. But he dropped
the joss-stick and&mdash;where is it Olivia?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"I put it in a drawer over there, after you showed
it to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ainsleigh went to a rose-wood cabinet and
opened a drawer. She then returned with the joss-stick
in her hand, and gave it to her husband, who
was kneeling on the hearth-rug. "I hope it won't
explode, Rupert," said Olivia nervously.</p>

<p>He stared. "Why should you think that?"</p>

<p>"Well it might have been dropped on purpose, and
looks like a cracker with that red paper round it.
Perhaps there's dynamite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Rupert taking out a match,
"however, if you are afraid, go into the next room."</p>

<p>"No," said Olivia seating herself, "if you are to
be blown to bits, I'll be blown up with you."</p>

<p>They both laughed at the idea, and then Rupert
lighted the match. It was distinctly nervous work
however, and Olivia started back, as her husband
set the joss stick fizzling. She was leaning forward
in the chair with her dark head nearly touching his
fair hair. The joss stick smoked slowly and a queer
odour diffused itself though the room. Olivia
sniffed. "Rupert," she said positively, "it's the
same scent as was on that letter of Tung-yu's."</p>

<p>"And of Lo-Keong also," said Rupert watching
the thick bluish smoke, which now began to curl up
from the joss stick, "apparently the Mandarin uses
the perfume as a kind of clue, or perhaps it is a
special scent dedicated to this private god of his. I
shall never understand Chinamen and I'm very sure
I don't want too. Olivia, hold the stick while I
wave the fan in the smoke."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Being now assured that the smoke was proceeding
from a harmless article, Mrs. Ainsleigh took the
stick and held it lightly, while her husband gravely
waved the out-spread fan in the thick smoke. The
joss stick fizzled and burned and gave out its queer
smell, which made both slightly dizzy. Every now
and then, Rupert looked at the enamelled side of the
fan, where Tung-yu said that a picture would appear.
There certainly did seem something scrawled on the
smooth green sticks, and a blurred outline revealed
itself. For quite ten minutes Ainsleigh continued
waving, until the joss stick burnt down nearly to the
root. Then he looked again, Olivia placed the still
fizzling joss stick in the fender, and peered over his
shoulder. She uttered a cry when she saw the
black outline of the picture, and Rupert nearly
echoed it. They were looking at a drawing of the
cloisters.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there were the cloisters of Royabay Abbey
taken, as by a camera, from the archway. The
architecture was clear enough, and the trees also.
But the picture was merely evanescent, for as the
fan grew cold again the outlines vanished. However,
they knew that the hiding place of the presumed
papers, was within the cloisters of Royabay&mdash;but
in what spot. Rupert laid down the fan and propounded
the problem to his wife. "The indications
would be more exact."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Olivia thoughtfully, and picked up
the fan, "I suppose you are right, Rupert. It must
have been Hwei who came to the Abbey on the
night my aunt was killed and dropped the joss stick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Perhaps he came to see if he could find the hiding
place, without the aid of the fan."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert, "Hwei is the servant of Lo-Keong,
and probably knew of the hiding place;
whereas Tung-yu, who served Hop Sing wanted the
fan to learn about it. I expect had Tung-yu bought
the fan, he would have come here and found the
papers and then have cleared out to China to place
them in his master's hands and ruin Lo-Keong."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there are papers hidden?" said
Olivia, fingering the beads dangling from the thick
yellow cord.</p>

<p>"I think so. It can't be gold or silver or jewels.
However, what we have to do is to find what is
hidden. Then when Lo-Keong comes down we can
make a bargain with him. If he hands over my
eight thousand, I'll give him whatever we find."</p>

<p>"But how are we <ins title="'to' was left out of the original text">to</ins> find the spot?" said Mrs. Ainsleigh
dreamily. "Oh, Rupert," she added, "it's in one
of the trees. Don't you remember a tree was drawn
at the side of the picture with a white line down the
trunk?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see that. I saw the four trees and
the stump drawn in the picture."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ainsleigh rattled the beads through her
fingers. "Four beads and half a bead," she exclaimed,
"Rupert, those stand for the four trees and
for the stump."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"The half bead&mdash;that is the stump, and see, one of
the beads is of jasper, that might be the copper
beech."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"By jove," Rupert jumped up, "I believe you
are right."</p>

<p>"I am sure I am, and in the tree drawn at the
side of the picture which you did not observe, there
was a white line down the trunk."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rupert pondering, "perhaps whatever
is hidden is tied to a string or a chain and is
dropped down the trunk of one of the four trees&mdash;or
perhaps in the stump."</p>

<p>"Not in the stump," said Olivia quickly, "for
then the line would be visible, while in the other
trees it would be concealed in the thick foliage. I
fancy the line must be down the copper beech trunk,
as there is but one red bead."</p>

<p>"There is but one tree though&mdash;one copper beech
you know," said her husband. "I am inclined to
think that to make things safer, the hiding place
must be in one of the green trees signified by the
jade beads. The question is, which tree is it?"</p>

<p>Olivia looked at the fan again, and as she did so
started. Rupert also raised his head. They heard
the sound of wheels scrunching the gravel outside,
and wondered who was arriving so late. The clock
pointed to half-past ten. The servants had gone to
bed, so Rupert followed by his wife, who was rather
nervous, went to the door. When Rupert opened it
he found himself facing a tall handsome man in a
fur cloak, and wearing a strange hat.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the stranger in the best of
English, "I speak to Mr. Ainsleigh I think, I am
the Marquis Lo-Keong."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Mandarin Explains</span></h4>


<p>"I must apologise for this very late visit," said Lo-Keong,
when he was conducted to the drawing-room
by his surprised host, "but I must explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not now, Marquis," replied Ainsleigh, giving his
visitor the rank which he claimed, "you must be
weary and hungry."</p>

<p>"No. I am perfectly well, and enjoyed a meal
before I left London. If you will give my servants
orders to take up my luggage, and will then hear
what I have to say, you will do everything I desire."</p>

<p>Rupert went again to the hall to tell the two
Chinese servants, which Lo-Keong had brought with
him, to take the trunks up to the bed-room which
the Marquis would occupy. Then he went to the
back and made Mr. and Mrs. Petley rise. Both were
disturbed when they heard that a Chinese grandee
was in the house. "I do hope he won't bring trouble
with him," said Mrs. Petley to her husband. "I
never could abear them things, since I saw that
creature who brought home the old master's baggage.
And, Missus, as is dead, couldn't bear him either."</p>

<p>"He was a cock-eyed man," said old John
reflectively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cock-eyed yourself," retorted the housekeeper
who had a better memory, "he was one-eyed, and
a nice ugly thing he looked. Ah well, as I
always says, Abbot Raoul don't walk for nothing,
and this Chiner gentleman coming here, means
trouble."</p>

<p>Old John who was much the same way of thinking
himself, grew annoyed by his wife's pessimism
and told her to hurry up and come to the kitchen.
Then he went to see after the bed-room which his
master had selected for the untoward guest. Mrs.
Petley came down to find her kitchen in the possession
of two grave silent Chinamen who had lighted
the fire and were boiling water for tea. "Well, I'm
sure," said Mrs. Petley surveying both with distaste,
"the idear of these furreiners taking liberties," and
she sniffed at the Far East.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rupert returned to the drawing-room
and found the Marquis paying attentions to his wife.
Lo-Keong was a tall, fine-looking man, grave and
extremely polite. He had admirable manners, and
his clothes were of the finest. Olivia in her rich
dinner dress, felt quite plainly dressed beside this
gorgeous gentleman, who wore a jacket of rose-pink,
a coat of grass green satin, pale blue silk trousers,
and thick-soled white green shoes. He also had a
glossy pig-tail woven with silk, and carried a small
fan&mdash;at which Olivia shuddered. Seated in a deep
arm-chair, he looked a potentate, quite out of place
in that sober English drawing-room. The Marquis
was very affable, and deferential to Mrs. Ainsleigh,
who quite overcame her dislike to Celestials after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
few moments converse with this splendid specimen
of the aristocracy of Cathay.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure you won't have some refreshment?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Lo-Keong waved his slim hand graciously. "I
thank you, no," said he, "and if you will allow me
to explain myself, you can then retire. I am ashamed
of having called at this hour. But," he looked at
Rupert first and at Olivia afterwards, "my excuse is
a good one. I have seen Hwei&mdash;whom you know."</p>

<p>Ainsleigh shuddered. "Yes, and I don't retain
any very pleasant recollections of that gentleman,"
said he.</p>

<p>Lo-Keong laughed quietly, "Hwei is a true devotée
of the god Kwang-ho."</p>

<p>"I don't understand about that god," said Olivia.</p>

<p>"I have come to explain," said the Chinaman, "it
is a great pity I did not come before. You would
then have had no trouble about this," and he took up
the famous fan which Olivia had tossed on the sofa.</p>

<p>"Oh," the young couple looked at one another, and
if they did not say "oh," the expression of "oh"&mdash;an
amazed "oh" was on their faces.</p>

<p>Lo-Keong seemed to have his eyes everywhere, and
took up the fan as if it was the most natural thing
it should be lying there. "You understand," he
went on in his calm well-bred voice. "I have seen
Hwei and he told me everything."</p>

<p>"About the murder?"</p>

<p>"About the murder, Mrs. Ainsleigh, and about
the hunt for the assassin; also about your husband's
visit to London, and full details concerning the folly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of Tung-yu&mdash;my enemy's servant, who related how
the picture on this," he laid a long yellow finger on
the fan, "could be brought to light," his eyes
wandered to the fragment of the joss stick within
the fender. "I observe that you have been clever
enough to see the picture."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rupert, quite amazed at this penetration,
"but how do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Very easily. Hwei told me that he came to the
cloisters one night to see that all was well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He knew of the hiding place then?" asked
Olivia, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I have always trusted Hwei, but
Tung-yu did not know, and hence his desire to
procure the fan. Hwei was here on the night poor
Miss Wharf was killed, and dropped the joss stick.
You have been clever enough to make use of it.
Well, now you both know where the packet
is?"</p>

<p>"The packet?"</p>

<p>"Of papers which mean my life&mdash;papers connected
with the Boxers, which the Mandarin Hop
Sing would give much to possess."</p>

<p>"We know that the packet is hidden in a tree,"
said Rupert, "but which tree we cannot guess."</p>

<p>"Ah," Lo-Keong slipped the beads through his
fingers, "here is a piece of jade with a gold band
round it."</p>

<p>"The third bead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Consequently the third tree. We will look for
the packet, as soon as I explain myself. The packet
must be safe, as you have the fan, and I know, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Ainsleigh, you are my friend, as I was the friend of
your father before you."</p>

<p>"What," Rupert threw back his head. "I
understood from Dr. Forge, that you were my
enemy."</p>

<p>Lo-Keong frowned. "Ah! he goes as far as
that," said he, then paused a moment. "I will
explain."</p>

<p>Olivia would have interrupted, but he threw out a
long arm in an imperious manner, and began his
story without further preamble, playing with the
fan all the time.</p>

<p>"My name," said the Marquis, "is Lo-Keong,
and I am a native of the province of Kan-Su&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where the mine is," murmured Rupert.</p>

<p>"Exactly, Mr. Ainsleigh. My native town is on
the Hwei River, and not far from the mine your
father bought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Along with Dr. Forge,"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but Dr. Forge did not buy it.
He was merely a servant of your father's. The
mine was owned by your father alone. I conducted
the negotiations on behalf of the owner of the land."</p>

<p>"But Forge says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can guess." Lo-Keong waved his hand coldly.
"He blackens my name to you, and lies about the
mine. Always bad&mdash;always foul, always a liar&mdash;that
man must be killed. I have spared him too long."</p>

<p>Olivia shuddered. "No Marquis," said she, "I
beg that there may be no more murders."</p>

<p>"Not in England, but when this Forge comes
again to China," here the Marquis smiled in a cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
way, but made no further remark. The young
people shuddered. He smiled benignly on them, and
went on with his story in a calm level voice.</p>

<p>"My respected parent was a merchant," said he
calmly, "and he gave me a fine education, of which, as
you know, we think greatly in the Middle Kingdom. I
secured the Hanlin degree, which is very high, and so
became greater than my friend Hop Sing, who failed.
That success made Hop Sing my enemy. I returned
home, and Hop Sing made trouble. It is not necessary
to explain how," added the Marquis with another
wave of his hand. "But the trouble resulted in my
leaving my parental roof, and becoming a soldier
with the Boxers who then conspired against the
Empress Dowager. But before I left my native
town, I acted as the middle man between a respected
resident and Mr. Markham Ainsleigh who desired to
lease a gold mine on the Hwei River. I left him in
full possession of the rights to work the mine, and
Dr. Forge assisted him."</p>

<p>"Not as a partner?" asked Rupert breathlessly.</p>

<p>"By no means, Mr. Ainsleigh. Forge was a good
doctor, but he knew nothing about mining. He
doctored the Coolies, and attended to minor matters.
Your father looked after the mine personally. I
understand he learned how to do so in California."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;He was there before I was born, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Permit me to continue, Mr. Ainsleigh. Well
then, I left your father in possession of the mine,
and joined the Boxers. I rose to be a leader,
and afterwards returned to see my parents. At that
time the rebellion&mdash;for that it was&mdash;proved unfortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>nate,
so it was necessary that I should conceal
myself, I took service with your father as a foreman
of the mine, and I can safely say," said Lo-Keong
with a certain show of emotion, "that your
father saved my life. I consider myself indebted to
him, and now I am indebted to his son."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you," said Rupert. "I need a
friend."</p>

<p>"You have one in me," said the Marquis courteously.
"But to proceed, as the night grows darker.
I was your father's friend, Hop Sing was his enemy,
and Forge sided with Hop Sing."</p>

<p>"But why did he do that?" asked Ainsleigh impetuously.
"Forge was at college with my father&mdash;they
were great friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So Mr. Markham Ainsleigh thought. But Dr.
Forge was greedy and wished to have the mine to
himself. Hop Sing, who had some influence at the
Imperial Court, promised to help Dr. Forge to get rid
of your father and secure the mine provided I was
ruined."</p>

<p>"And Forge acted this base part."</p>

<p>"He did," said the Mandarin quietly. "I may
tell you Mr. Ainsleigh that I was completely in your
father's confidence. He made a great deal of
money out of the mine, and I arranged for it to be
turned into safe investments through a third person
whose name need not be mentioned. A large sum
was placed out at interest and all these many years
the interest has been accumulating. You will
receive a handsome sum I assure you, Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"But," broke in Olivia perplexed. "Dr. Forge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
told my husband that the whole amount was
eighteen thousand, of which ten thousand belonged
to him and eight thousand to Rupert."</p>

<p>"Dr. Forge places the money obtained from the
mine at a low figure," said the Chinaman smiling,
"what the amount is, I shall tell you later. Meanwhile
I must explain the intrigue which led to your
father's murder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," Rupert leaped to his feet, "then he <i>was</i>
murdered."</p>

<p>"He was&mdash;by the emissary of Hop Sing. Be
calm, Mr. Ainsleigh, and be seated. Your father
died quietly enough by strangulation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What. Was he killed in the same way as Miss
Wharf?"</p>

<p>Lo-Keong bowed his stately head. "Yes, and by
the same person&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tung-yu," cried Olivia starting to her feet in
her turn.</p>

<p>"Exactly, Mrs. Ainsleigh. I know that Tung-yu
strangled Mr. Markham Ainsleigh, and I believe
that he strangled your aunt."</p>

<p>Rupert sat down on the sofa and drew his wife
down beside him. "But Tung-yu was the man who
was to buy the fan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so." Lo-Keong folded and unfolded the
fan calmly. "You know of the god Kwang-ho."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I can't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naturally," the Marquis laughed quietly, "that
is a thing beyond the comprehension of a Western
barbarian&mdash;your pardon for so calling you. Kwang-ho,"
went on the Mandarin, "is an ancestor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
mine who lived during the Ming dynasty. He was
a sage, and very famous, so I took him as my private
god."</p>

<p>Olivia looked amazed and a little shocked. "A
private god. I never knew that anyone could have
a private god even in China," she said.</p>

<p>"If you have read Roman history, Mrs. Ainsleigh,
you will remember the Lares and Penates, which
were something of the same kind. I was very unfortunate
with the public gods of my country, so I
chose Kwang-ho to be my genius&mdash;my destiny. I
had an image made and offered him incense. It
was, in fact what you might call ancestral worship;
only I looked upon Kwang-ho as one who could
control my destiny. I was right," said Lo-Keong
emphatically, "for, from the moment I sacrificed to
Kwang-ho, my fortunes changed."</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Rupert, wondering that a
clever man like this should talk so superstitiously.</p>

<p>"In every way. The priest of my new god Kwang-ho
consulted the deity and ordered that I should
leave the Boxers and attach myself to the party of
the Empress Dowager, who was to be all powerful
in the future. I think," added Lo-Keong smiling
blandly, "that Kwang-ho was right in that. Who
is so powerful as my august mistress."</p>

<p>"True enough," admitted Ainsleigh impatiently,
"but what has this to do with the death of my father?"</p>

<p>"Patience, Mr. Ainsleigh. I arranged to leave
the Boxers. We were fighting for the Emperor,
who was then being crushed by the Empress
Dowager. I had many papers showing my devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
to the Boxer cause and to His Imperial Majesty.
These papers I intended to destroy: but remembering
that some day the Emperor might overcome the
Empress, I decided to keep the papers. They
would show that I had worked for the Emperor,
and thus my fortunes would be secure should His
Imperial Majesty reign alone. As yet," added Lo-Keong
with a shrug, "he has not reigned alone and
my august mistress still rules the destinies of the
middle kingdom."</p>

<p>"Ah. And if she got those papers?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She would cut off my head," replied Lo-Keong
quietly, "so now you see why I thought it best to
conceal them. I wished to preserve the papers so
as to keep myself in favour with the Emperor, when
he became supreme, and I wished to conceal them
from the Empress Dowager and her spies, while she
ruled China. You understand?"</p>

<p>"We do," said the young couple. "So you used
the means of the fan to tell where they were hidden?"
asked Rupert,</p>

<p>The Mandarin assented. "I did. I spoke to
your father about this plan of concealment. I knew
the papers would not be safe in China, as the
emissaries of Hop Sing would find them, and I
should be ruined, so on the suggestion of your father,
I decided to hide them in England."</p>

<p>"But why in the Abbey?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Markham Ainsleigh's suggestion, sir. He
said that this place had been in the possession of his
family for years and would likely continue to remain
under the Ainsleigh&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas&mdash;alas," sighed Rupert.</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," was Lo-Keong's brisk reply,
"you will have enough money to keep this place I
assure you. But to continue&mdash;your father, whose
health was very bad, arranged to take his money
back to this place, and to take also the papers I
wished to hide. We arranged that they should be
concealed in the third tree and then I hit upon the
plan of an invisible picture on the fan with the
assistance of the beads to identify the hiding-place."</p>

<p>"But was that necessary when you knew the
hiding-place?"</p>

<p>"I wished my heirs to benefit by my services to
the Emperor during the Boxer rising; and they
were not to know of the existence of these papers
till I died. So you will understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! It's very interesting, so please go on."</p>

<p>"Well while we were arranging these things
Forge went to Pekin, and got a concession to work
the mine from the Empress through the influence of
Hop Sing. Meanwhile, I arranged to enter the
service of my Imperial Mistress, and left your father
ill of dysentery."</p>

<p>"Of which, according to Forge, he died."</p>

<p>"No," said the Mandarin decisively, "he was
recovering. He had the packet and the fan which
he was to take to this place. Hwei was to go with
him, and design the invisible picture and hide the
packet. I went to see about letting your father
have the money which I had invested for him. All
was ready and he was winding up his affairs. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the emissary of Hop Sing strangled your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tung-yu," said Rupert much agitated.</p>

<p>"I have already said that," replied the Marquis
rather tartly, "your father died, and Forge obtained
the mine. But he did not hold it long. I represented
that Forge had obtained the death of Mr. Markham
Ainsleigh through Hop Sing. The Empress took my
view. Hop Sing was disgraced and I was promoted.
Forge had to leave China for the time being, but he
came back several times. I sent Hwei to this place
with your father's effects and with the fan. He concealed
the packet and drew the picture. Your mother
was alive then, Mr. Ainsleigh, and Hwei showed her
the fan, though he did not tell her the secret."</p>

<p>"Ah," cried Rupert, "now I remember where I
saw the fan."</p>

<p>"Yes," Lo-Keong nodded, "as a boy of five you
may remember it."</p>

<p>"I certainly do. But Marquis, why did you not
send my father's money to my mother?"</p>

<p>"Ah. She died, and although I knew you were
the heir and in the guardian-ship of Forge who was
your enemy I could do nothing. Hop Sing got the
upper hand again and I was in my turn disgraced.
Then Hop Sing learned about the papers, and about
the fan being the means of finding the hiding-place.
He ordered Tung-yu to find the fan. Hwei was
bringing the fan back from England to me. He
was assaulted when he landed in China, but he
luckily had given the fan to a brother of his, so Hop
Sing could not find it. Then the brother was killed
and a coolie, who knew nothing of the fan, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
possession of it. Afterwards, I wanted the fan.
Hop Sing told me what he suspected, so I applied
to the god Kwang-ho. The god declared, through
his priest, that Hop Sing was to come with me to
the shrine. He did so, and thus, bitter enemies as
we were, we came for a time to be in peace."</p>

<p>"And then the arrangement was made?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The god said that an equal chance must
be given to good and evil. Hwei was appointed to
find the fan for me, and to give death to the person
who had it. Tung-yu acted for Hop Sing and was to
give a reward of not less than five thousand pounds
so that the person who held the fan should be rich
for life. Each was to hold sway for twenty-four
hours. I caused this to be published in the Chinese
newspaper in Pekin. The coolie heard it and being
fearful lest he should be killed, he kept the fan for
years and said nothing. Then Major Tidman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah I know. He came to see how my father
died."</p>

<p>"Quite so, Mr. Ainsleigh, and the coolie, knowing
the fan was connected with the death&mdash;for he afterwards
went to Kan-su mine and asked questions&mdash;gave
the fan to the Major to get rid of it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we know the rest," said Rupert rising. "Tidman
gave it to Dr. Forge, and he gave it to you&mdash;or
rather you caused it to be taken from him."</p>

<p>"No," said the Mandarin, "that is not true. I
never saw the fan till now. All these years I have
never set eyes on it."</p>

<p>"But Dr. Forge said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whatever he said he speaks falsely," said Lo-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Keong,
"but it is growing late, Mr. Ainsleigh, and I
see that your wife is weary. Let us retire and I
shall tell you the rest of the story to-morrow. But
before I go to rest," added the Mandarin decidedly,
"I must assure myself that the packet is still in the
trunk of the third tree."</p>

<p>Rupert was quite ready and lighted the lantern.
The two men went to the Abbey into the pitchy
darkness, and walked to the third tree near the bare
spot. Lo-Keong who seemed to be able to see in
the dark like a cat looked round, and laid his finger
on a huge oak. "This is the tree," said he
confidently.</p>

<p>"But I can't very well see," said Rupert, "from
which side do you count?"</p>

<p>"From the left to right," explained the mandarin,
"in these robes, Mr. Ainsleigh, I cannot climb the
tree, will you please to do so. You will find the
hollow trunk and the line. Pull it up: the papers
will be at the end. Bring them to me if you please."</p>

<p>So speaking Lo-Keong took the light and Rupert
although in thin evening dress began to climb the
tree. Luckily it was not difficult as the branches
hung low, but it was disagreeable on account of the
dripping wet. Every movement shook down much
moisture. However, the active young man disappeared
in the foliage and then felt round. He could
not see, and came down to get the lantern, which
the Chinaman passed to him. Then he found that
the trunk of the tree was broken off, amidst the
thick branches, and that the centre was hollow. He
espied a rusty thin chain, and pulled it up. At the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
there was a small box, which he brought down.
With an exclamation of joy Lo-Keong took it. It
opened easily in his hand.</p>

<p>"Gone," cried the Marquis in a voice of anguish.</p>

<p>He spoke truly. The box was empty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Who is Guilty?</span></h4>


<p>Next morning at the early hour of nine o'clock
Orlando Rodgers drove up to Royabay filled with
curiosity. He had received Rupert's letter which
summoned him to come down on matters connected
with the murder, and he was eager to learn details.
Rodgers himself, had been unlucky. He had traced
The Stormy Petrel to the Thames near Rotherhithe,
and had learned from the Captain that two Chinamen
had hired the boat for a couple of days. They went
down to Marport and had gone ashore early in the
evening. They came on board again after midnight,
and then had requested to be put ashore at Rotherhithe.
The Captain confessed that he had been paid
well for the job, and thought&mdash;with a wink&mdash;that
there was no chance of his knowing his employers
again.</p>

<p>Rodgers of course recognised that Tung-yu and
Hwei in their queer partnership had hired the yacht&mdash;which
it seems was a public boat anyone could
take for a period,&mdash;and he knew also that the den,
where Rupert and Clarence had met with their
adventures, was in Rotherhithe. He learned of this
from no less a person than Mr. Burgh himself, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the buccaneer called at the police office in London
to ask if the Chinamen had been caught. Rodgers
had extracted a full account of the adventures, and
had gone to the den only to find it empty, and the
Chinamen conspicuous by their absence. Burgh
himself had not returned as he promised, and the
detective was annoyed at this, after he heard Rupert's
story. Had he known what this was, he certainly
would have arrested Burgh there and then, for participation
in the murder. But the astute Clarence
in telling his Penter's Alley adventure, had taken care
not to incriminate himself.</p>

<p>On arrival the detective was shown into the drawing-room
where Rupert was sitting with the stately
Mandarin. Olivia was not present as she had heard
quite enough about the fan, and wished to hear no
more, not even the end of Lo-Keong's very interesting
story. Rodgers recognised that Lo-Keong was
of a different type of Celestial to Tung-yu and Hwei,
and paid him great deference. He explained to
Rupert his ill-success with the yacht Stormy Petrel,
and detailed the interview with Clarence.</p>

<p>"I wish I had told you about him in my letter,"
said Rupert jumping up, much annoyed with himself,
"you could have arrested him."</p>

<p>And when Rodgers heard the story, he blamed
Ainsleigh, as much as he blamed himself for not
having risked an arrest on suspicion.</p>

<p>"But you know, sir," said he, huffily, "Burgh really
didn't give himself away. I could do nothing to him&mdash;or
to the Captain of the Stormy Petrel either on
what evidence I hear. As to those Chinamen&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said Lo-Keong, "you must let me deal with
them Mr. Rodgers."</p>

<p>"Can you deal with Tung-yu."</p>

<p>The Mandarin drew down the corners of his mouth.
"I think so," said he, "it is my belief that he has
the papers."</p>

<p>"What papers, sir?"</p>

<p>Lo-Keong, seeing it was absolutely necessary to
make things plain, if he wanted to secure his precious
packet, related almost word for word the story he
had told on the previous night. "So you see," he
observed, "Tung-yu probably strangled Miss Wharf
as formerly he strangled Mr. Markham Ainsleigh. I
discussed this with Hwei, and he, knowing that Tung-yu
had betrayed him once, was much of the same
opinion."</p>

<p>"But if Tung-yu has the papers, why did he write
to Tidman?" argued Rupert, not inclined to take
this view.</p>

<p>"Probably to throw Hwei off the scent. Tung-yu
knows well enough that if he started for China,
Hwei would suspect he had the papers, and would
follow him to get them."</p>

<p>"By murder?"</p>

<p>"Probably," said the Mandarin indifferently, "and
after all sir, why not? Tung-yu killed your father
and Miss Wharf. Hwei is watching him, and if he
can make sure that Tung-yu has my parcel, he will
kill him&mdash;with my approval," ended Lo-Keong
calmly.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said Rodgers also coolly, though
the speech astonished him not a little, "when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
talked to Hwei, you did not know that the papers
had been stolen."</p>

<p>"No. But he who has the fan has the papers.
Hwei and I both thought that Tung-yu had the fan,
and therefore Hwei watches him. I came down
unexpectedly last night instead of waiting, so that
I might assure myself that the packet was safe.
But only a short time before, Mr. Ainsleigh found
the fan. Tung-yu must have come down and taken
the papers."</p>

<p>Rupert nodded. "Certainly. Without doubt he
was the ghost Mrs. Petley saw, and when she came
on him suddenly, he dropped the fan and fled. He
must have climbed the wall of the park in spite of
the spikes."</p>

<p>Lo-Keong smiled sourly, "I do not think anything&mdash;spikes
or otherwise would have kept Tung-yu
from gaining possession of those papers. And of
course he knew the way to make the picture visible."</p>

<p>"How was that. I thought only you and my
father and Hwei&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Mandarin calmly, "it seems that
Tung-yu overheard the discussion between myself
and your father as to the hiding of the papers and
the plan of the fan. When he strangled Markham
Ainsleigh, he hoped to find the packet at once.
But Hwei secured both the fan and the packet. I
have told you how they came to England, and how
Hwei gave the fan to his brother. The brother was
killed by accident and the coolie I spoke of, found
the fan in his clothing, knowing nothing of it's
significance. Then he learned the truth from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
notice I put in the Pekin paper, and was afraid lest
he should offend the god Kwang-ho. No he was
not afraid of death&mdash;few of us are in China. But
the anger of a god is different: it means ages
of torment and the chance of being born again in
the belly of some creeping animal. So the coolie
kept the fan, till he found an opportunity of giving
it to a foreign devil, in the person of Major Tidman.
I can't understand how he knew the Major wanted the
fan, save that he must have heard that Tidman was
searching for news as to the death of Markham
Ainsleigh. The coolie then knew, from enquiries at
the mine, that the fan was connected with the death,
and thus that the god Kwang-ho might have
appointed the death of Markham. Yes," said the
Mandarin complacently, "the coolie was afraid of
the god, and no doubt was glad when Major Tidman
took the fan."</p>

<p>Rodgers stared as Lo-Keong spoke. "It's rum
to hear a gentleman like yourself talk this way, sir,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Ah," smiled the Mandarin, "our Eastern ways
are different to yours."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the detective, "but you are so clever,
that I don't see how you can believe in all this stuff
about the private god."</p>

<p>Lo-Keong waved his hand imperatively. "Let us
not speak of that, or we anger Kwang-ho. He is
the controller of my destiny. Rather let us see
how we can recover my papers from Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"If he has them," put in Rupert perplexedly.
"And if so, Hwei will get them back."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Assuredly," replied the Mandarin, "the first
attempt that Tung-yu makes to leave England for
our own land, Hwei will guess the truth, and will
kill him to get the fan or the papers."</p>

<p>"But the fan is here."</p>

<p>"Yes. Hwei however thinks Tung-yu has it. I
shall tell him that Tung-yu has taken the papers."</p>

<p>"But by breaking the agreement come to before
the god, won't Kwang-ho be angry, Marquis."</p>

<p>"Hwei does not mind, he is my slave and will do
anything for me. No&mdash;No," added the Marquis
calmly, "as Tung-yu first disobeyed the god, in not
bringing Miss Wharf to meet with her doom at the
hands of Hwei, Kwang-ho will give him up to my
vengeance."</p>

<p>Neither of the Europeans could make anything of
this. "What we want to know," said Ainsleigh,
speaking for himself and Rogers, "is, how did the fan
get back to you?"</p>

<p>"I told you last night it did not get back," replied
Lo-Keong. "I heard from Hwei that the fan was
given to Miss Wharf by Burgh&mdash;but how he got it&mdash;"
Lo-Keong shook his head.</p>

<p>"From a pirate in Chinese waters."</p>

<p>"No. The fan never came back to China," Lo-Keong
took a paper out of his pocket, "I should have
given that to you last night. It will show you why
Hwei and Tung-yu came to look for the fan in
England," and he gave the paper to Rupert.</p>

<p>The young man read it. It was in scratchy female
handwriting, and was to the effect that the fan of the
Marquis was in the possession of a certain person in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
England. No name was signed to this paper, and
after Rodgers had read it, Lo-Keong took it again
and laid it on the table. "So you see," he remarked,
"when I got that letter, I knew the fan was in
England. I sent Hwei to search for it, and of course
Tung-yu on behalf of Hop Sing came also. They
could not find who had written the letter, and
advertised the fan as you know."</p>

<p>"Then Burgh told a lie," said Rupert.</p>

<p>Lo-Keong opened his mouth to speak, but before
he could do so, Mrs. Ainsleigh entered with a sheet
of foolscap in her hand. "I beg your pardon for
interrupting you gentlemen," she said excitedly, "but
here is something you should know. Rupert," she
turned to her husband and thrust the paper into his
hand. "It's from Dr. Forge."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Ainsleigh astonished. "Has he
dared to write?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he writes to some purpose. Read it
out Rupert. I am sure the Marquis and Mr. Rodgers
will be glad to hear."</p>

<p>"If it bears on the case," hesitated the detective.</p>

<p>"It does," answered Olivia seating herself, "listen."</p>

<p>Rupert glanced at the heading of the letter. "He
gives London as his address," he said, "so he
apparently is afraid of being caught."</p>

<p>"Read, dear," said Mrs. Ainsleigh impatiently.</p>

<p>Thus adjured Rupert began. "My dear Mrs.
Ainsleigh," said Forge in his communication, "I
write to you rather than your husband, as I think
you will judge me fairer than he will."</p>

<p>"As if I could," put in Mrs. Ainsleigh impatiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not a good man, and I never pretended to
be. But I have been poor all my life, and the lack
of money is the cause of my having acted in a way
which, otherwise I should not have done. There is
much truth in Becky Sharp's remark that anyone
can be good on five thousand a year. Had I
possessed that amount this letter would never have
been written. As it is, I write, because I hear that
the Marquis Lo-Keong is in England, and he will no
doubt, tell your husband his own story."</p>

<p>"Which is not creditable to Forge," said the
Marquis, suavely.</p>

<p>Rupert nodded and proceeded.... "I was at college
with Markham Ainsleigh, your husband's father,
and he believed in me. But I was always jealous
of him, as he was handsomer than I was; he possessed
an ancient and honoured name, and was
fairly well off. I was born of poor parents and was
of humble origin. Markham certainly helped me
with money and with influence, so that I obtained
my degree."</p>

<p>"And a nice way he repaid his obligations," said
Olivia, sharply.</p>

<p>"He's frank enough about his baseness at all
events," said Rupert, and then continued the letter.
"Markham wanted money, and as the doctor of a
liner to Hong-Kong, I had heard of a little-worked
gold mine on the Hwei River. I told Markham
about it, and proposed that he should go to China to
work the mine. He agreed, and took me with him,
as he thought that my medical knowledge would
benefit him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does Forge say he owned part of the mine?"
asked Lo-Keong.</p>

<p>"No. Listen," said Rupert, reading slowly. "I
was merely the doctor, as Markham bought the
rights to work the mine with his own money. But
he promised me a share, and my share now amounts
to ten thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"That is true in a way," said Lo-Keong, "out of
the money I pay you, Mr. Ainsleigh, this man can
certainly claim that amount."</p>

<p>"Then what I receive must be a large sum," said
Rupert.</p>

<p>The Chinaman smiled faintly. "Much larger
than you think," said Lo-Keong, "pardon my interruption
and proceed."</p>

<p>Rupert continued. "But I was not satisfied
with my share, and wanted all the money. Lo-Keong
had an enemy called Hop Sing, and he promised
if I could ruin Lo-Keong that he would put
Markham out of the way, and give me the money
which had been obtained by working the mine. I
knew that Markham had never sent any money
home, as he wanted to wait until he could become a
millionaire, and then return to astonish his wife,
and restore the splendours of Royabay. I therefore
saw Hop Sing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think you can leave all that out, Mr. Ainsleigh,"
said Lo-Keong, "it is the story I told you."</p>

<p>"So it is," said Rupert, running his eyes down
the closely written page. "Well&mdash;hum&mdash;hum," he
picked up the thread of the tale lower down. "It
seems," he said, speaking for himself, "that Hop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Sing fell into disgrace, and Forge could not get the
money. He went to China several times, as Hop
Sing recovered his position&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I fell into disgrace," said the Marquis,
"the Empress is a woman you know&mdash;pardon me,
Mrs. Ainsleigh&mdash;and whimsical."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rupert, smiling, "you seem to have
been up and down several times. When Hop Sing
was in favour, Forge went to China, but the
Mandarin refused to help him to get the money
which was under the control of Lo-Keong, unless
the fan was obtained. Forge learned the conditions
of the fan, and finally got it from the Major. He
took it to England and locked it up in a cabinet.
But he was afraid to take it to China or use it in
case Hwei should kill him."</p>

<p>"And Hwei would have killed him," said the
Marquis, "it was as well that Forge was so careful.
But how did he lose the fan?"</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey took it," said Rupert glancing at
the letter.</p>

<p>"A woman," the Marquis took the note from the
table, and passed it to Mrs. Ainsleigh. "Tell me,
madam, is that a woman's handwriting."</p>

<p>Olivia looked surprised. "It is Miss Pewsey's
handwriting."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Rupert, "so she wrote to Lo-Keong
telling him the fan was in England. Listen to
what the doctor says," and he began to read again.
"Miss Pewsey came to my house and was very
friendly. She wanted me to marry her, saying she
was trying to get Miss Wharf to leave her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
money, that should have been left to you Mrs.
Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Olivia significantly, "so she <i>did</i> work
for that. Go on."</p>

<p>The letter went on as follows:&mdash;"I didn't like
Miss Pewsey who was old and ugly and evil&mdash;much
worse than I ever was, in my worst days. But she
haunted my house and I got used to her. I used to
smoke opium, and grew very ill. In fact on more
than one occasion I became delirious. Miss Pewsey
came and nursed me. She took advantage of my
delirium to learn the whole story of the fan, and
learned also&mdash;don't be startled at this Mrs. Ainsleigh&mdash;that
through me Markham had lost his life."</p>

<p>"We know that from the Marquis," said Rodgers,
"but I suspect Mr. Forge wouldn't have spoken out
had he not guessed the Marquis would tell the whole
yarn. Go on Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey," went on the letter, "insisted
that I should marry her, or else she threatened to
reveal the story to Rupert. I was unwilling that
this should be, as I thought&mdash;and very rightly&mdash;that
I should get into trouble."</p>

<p>"And he would have," Rupert, broke off grimly to
explain, "I should have shaken the life out of him.
However, to continue," and he again began to read
this highly interesting letter. "I therefore agreed
to marry her, but always sought an opportunity of
escape. During one of my insensible fits after a
bout of opium smoking, Miss Pewsey took the key
from my watch chain and opening the cabinet gained
possession of the fan. I denied this to Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Tidman at Miss Pewsey's behest, or else Miss Pewsey
would have denounced me."</p>

<p>"Not she," said Rodgers, chuckling, "she would
have lost her husband had she done so."</p>

<p>"She has lost him in any case," said Olivia, "but
I can tell you what is in the rest of the letter, as I
see Rupert is tired of reading. Miss Pewsey gave
the fan to Clarence to give to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To win your favour," said Rupert.</p>

<p>"No. To bring about my death. Miss Pewsey
thought if I was out of the way, she would get Aunt
Sophia to leave her the money."</p>

<p>"What a wicked woman," said Lo-Keong, "we
have none such in China."</p>

<p>"Well," went on Olivia rapidly, "Miss Pewsey
wrote to the Marquis saying the fan was in England&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here is the letter," said Rodgers nodding towards
the epistle.</p>

<p>"Yes. How strange I should see it almost
immediately after Dr. Forge wrote," said Mrs.
Ainsleigh innocently.</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey laid her plans well," said Rupert,
looking again at the letter, "she intended to tell
Hwei that Olivia had the fan so that she should be
killed. But Olivia refused the fan, and Miss Pewsey
made Clarence give it to Miss Wharf, so that the
poor lady might be killed. But Miss Pewsey delayed
the death at the hands of Hwei by holding her
tongue, till a will was made in her favour. Chance
favoured her, for she got the will altered."</p>

<p>"By learning of our marriage when she played
the spy," said Olivia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite so," said Ainsleigh, "she then read the
advertisement and knew that the two men, Hwei
and Tung-yu, were in England. She wrote and told
them that Miss Wharf had the fan. The letter was
sent shortly before the ball, and after the new will
was made. Tung-yu, therefore, came down to the
ball to get the fan. This was not what Miss Pewsey
wanted, as she desired Hwei to kill the woman."</p>

<p>"She knew about the god Kwang-ho, then?"
asked Lo-Keong.</p>

<p>"I think so, but Forge isn't clear on that point.
However, he declared that he does not know who
killed Miss Wharf, nor who has the fan. He was
told by Clarence, how he,&mdash;Burgh, had accused him
to the Chinamen, and then grew fearful. Also, he
heard that the Marquis was in England, and so he
knew the whole story would come out. As he
dreaded arrest, he fled."</p>

<p>"But he could have prevented Burgh from speaking,"
said Olivia, "you know, Rupert, how Mr.
Burgh told you that Forge knew things about
him."</p>

<p>"I daresay if the Marquis had not come to England,
Forge would have silenced Clarence and fought
the matter out. But he knew that the truth about my
father's death would be told by the Marquis, and
also dreaded, lest he should be accused of Miss
Wharf's murder. He says that Clarence never gave
him the tie as he says he did, and declares that he
was in the card-room all the evening."</p>

<p>"How does he end the letter?" asked Rodgers.</p>

<p>Rupert read the last words. "So I write you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
this, Mrs. Ainsleigh, to show you that I am innocent
of the death of your aunt. I see that the game is
up and that I'll never get the ten thousand from
Lo-Keong. Also, if I remain, I shall have to marry
Miss Pewsey and cannot bear the idea. When you
get this I'll be far away on the sea on a voyage to a
land I need not particularise."</p>

<p>"Not China, I hope," said the Marquis, "if he
comes there again, I shall have to kill him. He
deserves to be punished for having brought about
the death of my friend Markham Ainsleigh. What
is to be done now, gentlemen? We are no further
on than before."</p>

<p>"We certainly don't know who had the fan,"
said Rodgers.</p>

<p>"Or who has the packet," put in Olivia.</p>

<p>"Tung-yu has it I am sure," said Lo-Keong.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you, Marquis," said the detective.
"Tung-yu and Hwei certainly cleared back
to Rotherhithe by that yacht, but if the fan had been
on board Hwei would have spotted it."</p>

<p>"Tung-yu is very cunning," said the Marquis
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rupert, folding Forge's letter up,
"I suggest that the Marquis should offer a large
reward for the fan with his own name appended.
Then whosoever has the packet will bring it. For
of course," added Rupert shrewdly, "those who
had the fan&mdash;if more than one&mdash;will have the
packet."</p>

<p>"Tung-yu&mdash;Tung-yu," said the Marquis shaking
his head, "however, I will try the advertisement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
appoint a place. I am willing to give a large sum
for the packet."</p>

<p>"And I am prepared to arrest the person who
brings the packet as the murderer of Miss Wharf,"
said Rodgers, "you leave the thing to me Marquis."</p>

<p>"Come with me to London my friend," said Lo-Keong,
"and we will write the advertisement. I
shall reward you largely, if you get this packet back
again."</p>

<p>"And what will you do, Rupert?" asked Olivia
eagerly.</p>

<p>Her husband looked up. "I shall hunt for the
packet on my own account."</p>

<p>"Good," said Lo-Keong in his stately manner,
"we will see who is fortunate enough to bring me
the packet and earn," he looked at Rupert impressively,
"one hundred thousand pounds."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">After-Events</span></h4>


<p>Rodgers went to London with the Marquis Lo-Keong
that very day, and Rupert wanted to go also.
But Olivia objected to this, she feared lest her
husband should be wounded again. "I don't wish
to lose you darling," said Mrs. Ainsleigh coaxingly.</p>

<p>"But the money," said Rupert dubiously.</p>

<p>"You mean the hundred thousand pounds," said
Olivia. "That will be paid to you by the Marquis.
It is rightfully your own."</p>

<p>"Humph! It seemed to me that Lo-Keong hinted
he would pay the money to whomsoever brought him
the packet. In that case Rodgers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Olivia quickly, "I am quite sure
that the Marquis means well to both of us. No
doubt he will reward Rodgers largely, should he get
the packet: but he will give you your father's
money."</p>

<p>"All the same I should like to hunt for the
packet on my own account, Olivia," said Rupert
obstinately.</p>

<p>"Let those hunt, to whom the packet is of
value."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe that this advertisement will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
bring forth anything," argued Ainsleigh frowning "if
Tung-yu has the packet, he certainly won't pass it
along to Lo-Keong. If Burgh stole it, he will be
afraid lest Hwei, who is in Lo-Keong's pay, should
kill him. As to Tidman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You thought he was guilty," said Olivia smiling.</p>

<p>"And I still have my doubts," rejoined her
husband, "so I'll call at the Bristol and have a
talk."</p>

<p>This conversation took place the day after the
Mandarin had departed and Rupert was worrying
about the exciting chase for the packet, which he
foresaw would take place. However, as Olivia insisted,
he should not risk his life again with Asiatics,
he interested himself still in the case by talking it
over with Major Tidman. On arriving at the Bristol,
he was shown up at once to Tidman's room, and
found the Major spick and span as usual, but greatly
excited.</p>

<p>"I was just coming up to see you," said the Major,
"look here?" and he handed Rupert the morning's
copy of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh looked at the place indicated by the
Major, and saw the advertisement asking for the
return of the fan, on delivery of which the sum of
five thousand would be paid. "I see that the
Marquis has lost no time," said Rupert throwing
down the paper, "he and Rodgers must have
inserted the advertisement at once."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Major staring, "so you know."</p>

<p>"Yes. Lo-Keong and Rogers were with me
yesterday."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lo-Keong. Why that is the man who owns the
fan?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. He is a Marquis, and high in the
service of the Empress Dowager of China. As to
the fan&mdash;" Rupert rapidly detailed how it had been
found in the cloisters and related also the subsequent
discovery, that the box attached to the chain in the
tree trunk, was empty. "And the man who took
the fan from Miss Wharf's dead body stole the
packet," said Rupert, "so it is not likely he will
risk arrest by coming forward to give the papers to
Lo-Keong."</p>

<p>Tidman sat down astounded at these revelations.
"I wish I had been present," said he, "I was always
curious about the fan's secret. A very ingenious
device, Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Very," assented Rupert dryly: then he cast a
side-long look on the Major, and spoke to the point.
"You had nothing to do with the stealing of the fan
I hope, Major."</p>

<p>"I," cried Tidman bouncing from his seat like an
india rubber ball.</p>

<p>"Well you see," went on Rupert, "we met on
the beach after eleven, but it is just possible in spite
of Forge's evidence, that Miss Wharf may have been
killed before then."</p>

<p>"And you believe that I killed her. Thank you
Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"My good friend," rejoined the young man
calmly, "Lo-Keong believes that Tung-yu broke his
oath before the god, and strangled Miss Wharf.
But I disagree with him, as Tung-yu could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
procured the fan by milder means, the next day.
Hwei could not have strangled the woman, as he
was haunting the Abbey grounds to see if the packet
was still safe. Forge, in a letter to my wife, insists
that he never got the tie, and certainly did not kill
Miss Wharf, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you have narrowed it down to me," cried
Tidman in a burst of indignation, "it's too bad of
you, Ainsleigh. I am not a thin skinned man by
any means: but I do feel this very deeply. I
swear," the Major flung up his hand dramatically,
"I swear that I never possessed the tie, and I
never killed Miss Wharf and I never took the fan
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," interrupted Rupert, "if you
did not take the tie, you certainly could not have
strangled the woman. After all, perhaps I have
been too hard on you, Major."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tidman angrily, "you are prepared to
take my word for it now, unsupported by other
evidence. Your accusation can't be made seriously,
Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Well upon my soul," said Rupert passing his
hand through his hair, "I really don't know what to
think or say. This case seems to grow more
mystical at every step. I admit that, as you
deceived me at the time, we discussed the advertisement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think I deceived you again. Well I did not.
That was my one and only deception. I wanted the
fan in order to procure money I admit: but the
danger of being killed by Hwei instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
rewarded by Tung-yu was too great. I dropped the
matter."</p>

<p>"Then who do you think is guilty?"</p>

<p>"Clarence Burgh. Oh I am sure of it. He
admits that Miss Pewsey told him the tie was in the
over-coat pocket. No doubt he took it out and used
it to incriminate you. Then again, Burgh learned
from Tung-yu how the picture could be rendered
visible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True enough," mused Rupert, "well, he might be
guilty. And he certainly was in the cloisters
one day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So as to examine the place," said the Major.
"And afterwards, he came at night in the monk's
disguise, knowing about the ghost and the legend.
He was startled when he secured the packet and left
the fan by accident on the black square."</p>

<p>"Or by design" said Ainsleigh, "remembering the
prophecy which says that 'gold will come from the
holy ashes.' If I get this one hundred thousand
pounds the prophecy will certainly be fulfilled, in a
sort of way. It was indirectly owing to the fan that
Lo-Keong told me of the money my father made in
China, and through the fan, when the packet is
restored, he intends to give the money to me."</p>

<p>"Oh humbug," said the Major contemptuously
"I don't believe in that foolish rhyme a bit. But
are you of my opinion that Burgh is guilty?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in the way you put it, it seems probable."</p>

<p>"Well then," said <ins title="Tidmam">Tidman</ins> angrily and striking
the table with his fist. "I have had enough of
being suspected, so I'll help you to hunt down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
assassin. I <i>must</i> know who killed Miss Wharf, or
else you will be accusing me again. See here," and
he threw a paper on the table.</p>

<p>It was a square of yellow paper, strongly perfumed,
which asked the Major to bring the fan to
the den in Penter's Alley. "You showed me this
before," said Rupert. "I went up on your behalf."</p>

<p>"Look at the date," said Tidman pointing, "it's
a new invitation. I think Tung-yu&mdash;who writes
the letter&mdash;believes I killed the woman and have the
fan after all. Well, last time, you went on my
behalf, this time, danger or no danger I'll go myself.
You can come if you like."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly come," said Rupert jumping up,
"Olivia does not want me to proceed further in this
matter, but, now that you are going, I'll go too.
Tung-yu can't know that the fan is in my hands, or
that the packet is missing."</p>

<p>"He's not so clever as I thought he was," said
Tidman coolly, "or he wouldn't have bungled this
affair as he has done. I am not afraid of him, now.
But you see that the appointment is for to-morrow
night at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"At Penter's Alley under the lantern. Exactly&mdash;the
same place. But as Rodgers knows of my
adventure, I wonder Tung-yu risks another meeting.
Besides, Rodgers told me he had been to the den
and found both Chinamen gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, thunderbolts never strike in the same spot
twice," said Tidman, "it is the safest place.
Rodgers, having gone once, will not go again.
Well, will you come?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Rupert, firmly and went back to the
Abbey, to persuade his wife to let him make one
more attempt to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>Olivia was obdurate at first, but after a time, she
yielded, though she assured Rupert she should be
miserable all the time he was away. "And <i>do</i> take
care of yourself," she said.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll take every care," replied her
husband; and so it was arranged that Rupert should
go up to town with Major Tidman by the six o'clock
train the next evening, and proceed to Penter's
Alley, to see Tung-yu, and learn&mdash;if possible, the
truth.</p>

<p>Olivia's attention was somewhat taken off the
projected expedition to the wilds of Rotherhithe, by
a visit from Lady Jabe. That eccentric female,
looking more like a judge than ever, and dressed in
a most manly fashion appeared, with a shining face,
to announce that Chris was engaged to marry Lotty
Dean.</p>

<p>"It's most delightful," said Lady Jabe, "her
father is merely a retired grocer, but I have consented
to over-look that, if he settles some money
on the young couple."</p>

<p>"And has he consented?" asked Olivia languidly.
She did not take much interest in the affairs of Mr.
Walker.</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Dean has allowed his daughter a
thousand a year, paid quarterly," said Lady Jabe
amiably, "and that, with what Chris earns at the
office, will keep us nicely."</p>

<p>"Us?" echoed Mrs. Ainsleigh smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," was Lady Jabe's calm reply, "I
have been a mother to Chris, and I intend to be a
mother to Lotty. I shall look after the house, and
control the purse, otherwise, the young pair may
get into the bankruptcy court."</p>

<p>Olivia privately thought that under Lady Jabe's
care the young couple, would have a bad time, even
though they might be free from bankruptcy. "What
does Mr. Walker say?"</p>

<p>"Oh Chris is delighted. He had better be. I'd
like to see him cross me, dear Olivia. I've broken
his spirit thoroughly. Lotty certainly is a trifle
difficult, but I'll break her also by degrees."</p>

<p>"I think you should leave Mr. and Mrs. Walker
to manage their own affairs," said Olivia indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh dear me no," replied Lady Jabe calmly,
"that would never do. A couple of babies, my dear
Olivia, who need a firm hand. I'll look after them
and receive a small sum for doing so. My late
husband did not leave me well off," she went on
confidentially, "so it is necessary that I should do
the best for myself. But now, that's all settled
and I'm glad you are pleased."</p>

<p>"Not with your proposed arrangement, Lady
Jabe."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you are, dear Olivia. Nothing could be
better, whatever you may say. And now to talk of
other and less pleasing matters. Miss Pewsey who
robbed you of your inheritance, is about to leave
Marport. Yes&mdash;you may look surprised: but she
is selling Ivy Lodge and intends to go to
America."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"In search of the doctor?" asked Mrs. Ainsleigh
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Quite so, I understand that Dr. Forge has gone
there. But just think what a brazen women Miss
Pewsey must be, to follow a man who left her&mdash;as
you might say at the altar. Miss Pewsey is in
London now making arrangements to sail for New
York&mdash;so she told me yesterday. I wish her all
joy," added Lady Jabe shaking her head, "but I
fear the man will spend her money and leave her."</p>

<p>When Lady Jabe went, Olivia thought over the
projected departure of Miss Pewsey on the trail of
Dr. Forge. She was glad at heart, that her enemy
was leaving Marport, but could not help thinking
that the bitter little women was going out of her
way to make trouble, for herself. And as Forge
was wanted, for participation in Markham Ainsleigh's
murder, Olivia though she would inform her
husband of his whereabouts, so that he might be
brought back if necessary. But Rupert listened
thoughtfully, and then replied after consideration.</p>

<p>"I won't move in the matter," he said calmly,
"Forge behaved like a scoundrel, but as he has gone,
I leave him in God's hands. He will get his deserts
yet, Olivia."</p>

<p>"Will you send him the ten thousand pounds,
Rupert?"</p>

<p>"No," said the young man decisively. "I shall
certainly not do that. Forge deserves some punishment
and shall have it, by being deprived of the
money he sinned to obtain. He did not kill my
poor father, but he certainly brought about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
death indirectly. Leave him to God, Olivia. As for
ourselves, we will get our own money from Lo-Keong,
and restore the Abbey."</p>

<p>"And Miss Pewsey's mortgage?"</p>

<p>"It is due shortly before Christmas, and I shall be
able to pay it off before then. Miss Pewsey has done
her worst, Olivia. Henceforth she will be harmless."</p>

<p>"And what about her punishment, Rupert?"</p>

<p>"I should think the loss of Forge has punished
her. And, if she really intends to follow him, she
will be more disappointed. The man will not
marry her. No, Olivia, Miss Pewsey also sinned to
get money, but she will be punished, you may be
certain."</p>

<p>The next evening Rupert again assumed his old
suit and heavy cloak and went away. Olivia clung
to him as he left the door. "Oh my darling be
careful," she said, "if you are killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't be," Rupert assured her. "I have taken
the precaution to write telling Rodgers of this meeting.
He will bring, by my advice, a couple of plaincloth
policemen to Penter's Alley, and if there is
trouble, both the Major and I will be able to get
away."</p>

<p>Comforted thus, Olivia kissed her husband, and
saw him drive down the avenue. Then she returned
to her room to count the moments, until he
returned. All their troubles had brought Olivia
and Rupert closer together, and in their implicit
trust in one another, lay the elements of future
happiness.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh found the Major also plainly dressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
waiting at the station, and the two were speedily on
their way to town. Owing to an accident to the
train, they were late in arriving at Liverpool Street
station and the Major fumed. "We won't be in
time," he said when they went to the underground
railway.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think so," said Rupert calmly, "it's just as
well, we should not be too early. I want Rodgers
and his men to be on the spot."</p>

<p>"But what do you think will come of all this?"
asked Tidman, nervously.</p>

<p>"I think we will find the papers."</p>

<p>"But if Tung-yu had them, he would not have
written to me."</p>

<p>"He is playing some sort of game. I can't
understand, and I have given up theorizing. Let us
wait."</p>

<p>The Major grumbled a little, but finally agreed
that Ainsleigh was right. They soon arrived at
Rotherhithe, and stepped out into the main street.
The night was fine, and there was a bright moon.
"I like this better than when I was here last," said
Rupert, as the two went down to Penter's Alley.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing there's a moon," said the Major
casting a glance upward, "if these Chinamen try to
bolt, we can chase them."</p>

<p>"Do you expect Hwei to be there also?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," said Tidman, "but if Tung-yu is, I
suspect Hwei won't be far off. They work in couples
as you know."</p>

<p>"And pull against each other like ill-matched dogs,"
said Rupert, "a queer compact, this."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's silly. I think the Mandarin must be mad
with all this rubbish about his gim-crack god Kwang-ho.
Here we are&mdash;and there's the lantern. What
a narrow street."</p>

<p>They stepped down the Alley in the bright moonlight.
The lantern flared above the same house as
Rupert had entered before, and at the door stood a
small figure. It was the Chinese boy dressed in red.
"Ah," said Rupert significantly, "Hwei is certainly
here, as well as Tung-yu. We'll have trouble."</p>

<p>"If Hwei tries to kill me, I'll shoot," said the
Major, and produced a neat revolver. "I've held
my life in my hands before now."</p>

<p>Rupert was about to speak to the boy who stood
silently before the closed door, when he heard a long
agonised scream within the house. The boy smiled
in a cruel manner, and Rupert tried to dash past.
But the boy prevented him. Tidman, however, was
more fortunate and flung himself against the door.
Evidently, a tragedy was taking place inside. As
the Major ran forward, the door opened suddenly and
Burgh dashed out and down the street, towards the
river. After him came Tung-yu, his face alive with
fury. Tidman gave a shout, and made after the two,
but Rupert, wondering who was being killed, sprang
down the passage and entered the room, where
formerly he had met with the adventure. A tall
Chinaman was standing in the middle of the floor
wiping a knife on his blouse. He turned, and
Rupert beheld Hwei. The Chinaman pointed to the
floor with a ghastly smile. "The doom of the god
Kwang-ho," said he, and ran out of the house swiftly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert cast his eyes on a body lying on the floor.
It was that of a woman and from her breast a stream
of blood was flowing. She was not yet dead, but
looked up with a pain-drawn face. Ainsleigh drew
back with an exclamation. It was Miss Pewsey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Chase</span></h4>


<p>Rupert stared at the wounded woman amazed.
How came Miss Pewsey into this den? He was so
astonished, that he forgot to call for assistance.
Miss Pewsey gave a moan and opened her eyes. At
once she recognised Ainsleigh, for the light from the
tasselled lantern overhead, fell full on his amazed
face.</p>

<p>"So you are safe," said Miss Pewsey with difficulty,
"didn't Tung-yu kill you."</p>

<p>"I have just arrived," said Rupert, "your nephew
has gone out followed by Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"I hope he'll catch him," muttered Miss Pewsey,
"Tung-yu stabbed me. Clarence snatched the
papers and ran away leaving me here to die."</p>

<p>"How did you get the papers?" asked Rupert
startled.</p>

<p>"I got them from Clarence&mdash;he asked me to come
up here, and&mdash;oh," she fell back insensible. Rupert
thought she was dead and forgetting where he was,
cried loudly for assistance. He heard footsteps approaching
and Lo-Keong in sober attired entered.
The stately Chinaman was roused out of his usual
self. He appeared disturbed and his face was dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>torted.
"Rodgers and his men are chasing Tung-yu,"
said Lo-Keong grasping Rupert's arm, "go after
them. Tung-yu has the papers."</p>

<p>"But Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>Lo-Keong started back. "That woman," he cried,
as startled as Rupert had been, "pooh, let her die.
She deserves her fate. She has been the cause of the
trouble. Go&mdash;go, Mr. Ainsleigh&mdash;go after Tung-yu."</p>

<p>"But Miss Pewsey!" repeated Rupert, seeing the
woman open her eyes, and recognising that life yet
remained.</p>

<p>"I'll see to her. I'll get a doctor." Lo-Keong
struck the gong near the door. "But get me those
papers. All my life depends upon them. Remember&mdash;one
hundred thousand pounds&mdash;go&mdash;go. It
may be too late. Don't allow Tung-yu to escape."</p>

<p>Rupert was quite bewildered as the Chinaman
pushed him out of the door. Then, recognising that
he could do nothing to help Miss Pewsey, and that
Lo-Keong, for his own sake would do all he could to
keep her alive, so that he might learn how the packet
came into her possession, Rupert ran out of the
house, and found the street filled with screaming
Chinamen and chattering Europeans. Some policemen
were coming down the alley from the main
thoroughfare, and everyone appeared to be alarmed.
The ragged mob rushed into various doors, at the
sight of the officers, but the Chinamen still continued
to cackle and scream. Suddenly Rupert heard a
revolver shot, and wondered if the Major had got
into trouble. Remembering that Burgh, with Tung-yu
in pursuit, had gone down the alley towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
water, he raced in the same direction, and at once,
two policemen, seeing him go, followed. There was
no time to undeceive them, so Rupert ran on, eager
to come up with Burgh. He had the papers, according
to Miss Pewsey, and in spite of Lo-Keong's statement,
Ainsleigh suspected that Miss Pewsey was
right. Else Tung-yu would not be in pursuit of the
buccaneer. As Rupert tore down the moonlit
alley, he heard the high clear voice of the Mandarin
calling on the police to stop. Then the tumult recommenced.</p>

<p>It mattered little to Ainsleigh. As he raced blindly
on, he felt a thrill of joy in his veins. It seemed
to him that he had never lived before, and that this
man-hunt was the climax of life. At the end of the
Alley he came on a dilapidated wharf, which ran out
into the turbid water, and saw a stout figure dancing
on this. At once he hurried down to find Major
Tidman, who recognised him at once.</p>

<p>"There was a boat waiting," gasped the Major
seizing Rupert's arm. "Burgh jumped into it and
pushed off. Tung-yu came after, and as the boat
was already in mid-stream he plunged into the water."</p>

<p>"Where is Hwei?"</p>

<p>"Rodgers and his men are after him. I fired a
shot, and I believe, I hit Tung-yu, as he was swimming.
Who has the papers?"</p>

<p>"Burgh. Keep a look out for him. I'll run
along the bank," and before the Major could expostulate,
Ainsleigh dashed up the wharf and ran
along the bank of the river.</p>

<p>He did this because his quick eye had seen a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
head bobbing in the water below the wharf. The
swimmer was evidently making for the near shore.
Rupert did not know if it was Tung-yu or Hwei,
but hurried at top speed along the bank, in the hope
of catching the man when he came ashore. He
sped along a kind of narrow way, for here the old
houses of Rotherhithe came down, almost to the
water's edge. There were lights in some of the
windows, but for the most part, these were in darkness.
To Rupert's left, loomed the house, and on his
right was the river bank, shelving down to the glittering
water. A few piles ran out into the stream, and
as the river was low, there were acres of evil-smelling
mud. The man was making for the bank and
battling hard against the stream, which was sweeping
him down. Rupert shouted, and seeing him on the
bank, the swimmer seemed to stop, apparently
dreading the reception he would get.</p>

<p>Finally he resumed his stroke, and made for a
wharf, some distance down. Ainsleigh ran for this,
but was stopped by a wooden fence. He managed
to climb over, and raced on to the wharf; but the
swimmer was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Rupert caught sight of a figure crawling
up the bank a little distance below, and again ran up
the wharf to the pathway. The man who had
landed caught sight of him, and leaping on to the
hard path, ran along the river bank, but in a swaying
manner, as though his powers of endurance were
exhausted. Considering how hard he had battled
with the current, probably the man's strength had
given out and Rupert, feeling fresh and fit, thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
he would have no difficulty in catching up. But the
man ran hard, and then dropped out of sight below
the bank. Apparently he had taken to the river
again. Rupert raced down so quickly, as to overshoot
the mark, where the man had slipped down.
While looking round, he caught sight of him again.
He ran up the bank and dodged into a narrow side
street. Rupert was after him in a moment. The
man had vanished round a corner&mdash;so Ainsleigh
thought&mdash;but when Rupert came after, he saw the
street in the moonlight was perfectly empty, and
turned back. The fugitive had tricked him, by
dodging into a dark corner, and was again on the
bank. He leaped on the wharf, and scrambled down
the piles to a boat which swung at the end of a long
rope. While he hauled this in painfully, and
pantingly, Rupert leaped on him. The man looked
up with an oath, and closed with his pursuer. It
was Burgh.</p>

<p>"The papers&mdash;the papers," gasped Rupert, "you
give them up."</p>

<p>"I'll kill you first," said Burgh setting his teeth,
and, exhausted as he was, he struggled with preternatural
strength. The two men swung and swayed
on the edge of the wharf, till Burgh tripped up his
opponent and both fell into the water. Rupert still
held his grip, and felt the body of Burgh grow heavy.
He rose to the surface, dragging at the buccaneer,
and, as the two had fallen into shallow water, Rupert
staggered on to the evil-smelling mud. He was
obliged to let go Burgh, who, apparently, had been
playing possum, for he rose to his feet and made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
feeble attempt to climb the bank. Seeing this,
Rupert, who was almost exhausted himself with the
long pursuit and the cold doûche, struck out, and
Burgh, with a cry of rage fell flat into the mud. The
next moment Rupert was kneeling on his chest.
"The papers, you scoundrel," he said between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"Haven't got them. Tung-yu&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You lie. Give me those papers, or I'll tear
your clothes off to find them."</p>

<p>Burgh tried to utter a taunting laugh, but the
effort was too much for his strength. He stopped
suddenly, and with a sob closed his eyes. The body
became inert, and as Rupert could see no wound, he
concluded that the buccaneer had fainted. At once
he removed his knee, and began his search. He
went deliberately through the pockets of the insensible
man, and finally came across a packet
bound in red brocade. It was in Burgh's breast,
next to the skin. Rupert, with this in his hand,
rose with a gasp of relief. He had the papers after
all, and now, could hope to get the money from the
Mandarin. He slipped the important packet into
his pocket, and then producing a flask of brandy, he
forced a few drops between the clenched teeth of
his antagonist. He did not wish the man to die,
and moreover, he was desirous of questioning him.
In a few moments Burgh opened his eyes. "You,"
he said, as soon as he recovered his scattered senses,
and he made an effort to rise.</p>

<p>"No you don't," said Rupert pushing him back,
"you'll try and reach for your revolver."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go slow," muttered Burgh, lying on his back in
the mud. "I give in, Ainsleigh. You've won."</p>

<p>"I've got the papers, if that's what you mean.
They shall be given to Lo-Keong."</p>

<p>"And you'll get the five thousand."</p>

<p>"I'll get one hundred thousand," said Rupert,
keeping a watchful eye on his late opponent.</p>

<p>"Huh," said Burgh with a groan, "what luck.
And all I have got, is a ducking. Let me up and
give me some more brandy. Remember, I saved
your life from Forge, Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"Quite so, and you tried to kill me just now," said
Rupert dryly. "I think we are quits. However,
here's the brandy, and you can sit up. No treachery
mind, or I'll shoot you," and Rupert pulled out his
Derringer.</p>

<p>The buccaneer gave a grunt and sat up with an
effort. "I'm not up to a row," he gasped. "There's
no fight left in me. Great Scott, to think I was so
near success. I'll be poor for the rest of my life, I
guess."</p>

<p>"You'll be hanged for the murder of Miss Wharf,
you mean."</p>

<p>Burgh took a deep draught of the brandy, which
put new life into his veins. He actually grinned
when he took the flask from his lips. "I reckon
that's not my end," said he. "I never killed the old
girl. No sir&mdash;not such a flat."</p>

<p>"Then who did kill her?"</p>

<p>"Find out," was the ungracious response.</p>

<p>"See here, Burgh," said Rupert, swinging himself
on to a pile of the wharf. "I mean to get to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
bottom of this business, once and for all. The
papers shall be given to the Marquis and then, I
hope, we shall hear the last of this fan business.
But I must know who killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there," said Burgh with a shrug, and
after another drink, "I cave in: you've got the
bulge on me. But I guess, if you want to keep
those papers, you'd best clear out, Tung-yu will be
along soon looking for them. I leaped into a boat
and pushed out, but that Chinese devil swam after,
and when I got into trouble with the oars, he climbed
on board with a long knife. I jumped over-board
and made for the bank, where you raced me down.
But I guess Tung-yu will bring that craft of his
ashore, and he's hunting for me like a dog as he
is."</p>

<p>"Rodgers, and Hwei, and Lo-Keong, and a lot of
policemen are hunting for Tung-yu," said Rupert
coolly, "so you need give yourself no further trouble.
Tell me why you killed Miss Wharf?"</p>

<p>"I didn't, confound you," growled Burgh.</p>

<p>"Then you know who did?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it was Forge."</p>

<p>"That's a lie. Forge wrote to my wife, and
denied that you gave him the tie."</p>

<p>"Then Tidman killed the old girl."</p>

<p>"No. He was with me on the beach. Come
now, you shan't get off in this way. Tell me who is
guilty?"</p>

<p>"If I do, will you let me go?"</p>

<p>"I make no bargains. Out with it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Burgh looked black, but being tired out and at the
mercy of Rupert's revolver, he growled sulkily, "It
was Aunt Lavinia."</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey&mdash;that frail little woman&mdash;impossible."</p>

<p>"Frail," echoed the Buccaneer with scorn, "she's
as tough as hickory and as wicked a little devil as
ever breathed. Why, she learned about the fan from
Forge when he was delirious, and gave away the
show to Lo-Keong in China&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know that. And she wished Olivia to have
the fan, that she might be killed."</p>

<p>"That's so, you bet. But old Wharf got it, and
so, was killed."</p>

<p>"But not by Tung-yu, or Hwei."</p>

<p>"No." Burgh took a final drink, and having
emptied the flask, flung it into the river. Then he
took out a cigarette, which was dry enough to light.
When smoking, he began to laugh. "Well this is a
rum show," said he. "I guess you've got all the
fun. I'm sold proper."</p>

<p>"Tell me your story," said Rupert imperatively,
"I want to get back to Penter's Alley to see your
aunt."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess she's a goner by this time," said
Burgh easily, "Tung-yu knifed her."</p>

<p>"You mean Hwei. I found him wiping the
knife."</p>

<p>"No. Tung-yu stuck her, and dropped the
knife. Aunty was just passing the packet to Hwei,
when Tung-yu stabbed her. I reckon he intended
to grab the packet, but I was too sharp for him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
caught it away from his hand. Then I raced out
and he after me. Hwei stayed behind to clean the
knife, I reckon."</p>

<p>"No, he followed you two almost immediately."</p>

<p>"Then both Chinamen will be here soon. You'd
best cut."</p>

<p>"Not till I learn the truth."</p>

<p>"I've told you the truth," snapped Burgh, in a
weary voice. "My old aunt strangled Miss Wharf.
Yes. Aunty told me of the tie, and asked me to get
it for her. I didn't know what she wanted to do
with it, so I did. I took it out of your pocket when
Dalham was out of the room. Then I gave it to
aunty. She told Miss Wharf that Tung-yu wanted
to see her on the steps, after eleven. Miss Wharf
went there and then aunty followed and sat down
beside her on the steps. I guess she kept her in talk
and then slipped the tie round her old throat and
pulled with all her might. And she's strong, I can
tell you," added Clarence confidentially. "She
nearly broke my arm one day twisting it. Miss
Wharf hadn't time to call out, and was a deader in
two minutes, for aunty froze on to her like death."</p>

<p>"Death indeed," murmured Rupert with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Well then aunty bucked up round by the front
of the hotel with the fan in her pocket and left the
tie round the neck of the old girl, so that <i>you</i> might
hang. All went well, but the next day I went to
aunty and asked for the fan. She was very sick, as
she intended to sell it that day to Tung-yu. But
Tung-yu had cut along with Hwei in the yacht, both
thinking they might be accused of the murder. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
thought that old Tidman did the biznai," grinned
Burgh, "and I let them think so, having my own
game to play with aunty."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ainsleigh shortly, "and what did
you do?"</p>

<p>"I told aunty I'd split if I didn't get the fan, so
she passed it along to me. Then I learned about
the secret from Tung-yu&mdash;the waving in the smoke
you know. I found out the kind of smoke from
Forge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And repaid him by a lying accusation."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Burgh coolly, "there ain't no
flies on me. But let's heave ahead. It's cold sitting
here."</p>

<p>"Go on then," said Ainsleigh sharply.</p>

<p>"Well I learned about the picture, and guessed
about the abbey. The picture was plain enough.
I came that day you found me, to see the place."</p>

<p>"And stole the packet then?"</p>

<p>"No, I waited till night and rigged myself up as
the Abbot. I knew it would make anyone sick
who saw a monk about at that hour."</p>

<p>"Not me," said Ainsleigh, "if I had caught
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well you very nearly did," confessed Burgh
candidly, "I came at night and climbed all four
trees before I nipped the box. Then I prized it
open and climbed down leaving the box, so that Lo-Keong
might get sold when he came to look. Just
as I got down, that old housekeeper of yours
screeched, and cut. I was startled, and dropped
the fan. Not wishing to leave that behind, I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to look for it. Then you and the butler turned up
and I lighted out sharp."</p>

<p>"What happened next?"</p>

<p>"Well I wanted the money, but not knowing the
days of Hwei and Tung-yu, thought I might get
stabbed, instead of the money. So I took the packet
to Aunty, and asked her to go up, telling her Tung-yu
would give her the money. She fell into the
trap."</p>

<p>"But she knew that Hwei&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wasn't Hwei's day," said Burgh, "at least it
turned out so, though I didn't know it at the time,
and so sent on Aunty to get the cash. I intended
to pull the dollars out of her when she did get them,
or leave her to die if Hwei knifed her."</p>

<p>"You blackguard."</p>

<p>"Go slow," said Burgh coolly, "aunty was no
friend to you. I say, do you know why aunty
wanted me to marry Olivia. It was because I'm
married already and if&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no further. Rupert knocked him backwards
into the mud. Burgh leaped to his feet, and
suddenly cried, "Look behind." Rupert did so very
foolishly, and Burgh flung himself forward. But
all the same Burgh was right to warn Ainsleigh. A
man was staggering along the wharf. He was in
Chinese dress.</p>

<p>"Knife him, Tung-yu," cried Burgh, struggling
with Rupert, "I'll hold him. He's got the papers."</p>

<p>The Chinaman gave a screech and hurled himself
on the pair. Rupert wrenched himself away from
Burgh and struck out at Tung-yu. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
moment he heard another cry, and Hwei came
leaping down the wharf. Before Tung-yu could
turn, his enemy was on him, and as Rupert was
again closing in death grips with Burgh, he had no
time to see what was taking place. He could hear
the Chinamen snarling like angry cats on the wharf,
and was himself fighting in the mud with Burgh
for his life. Luckily Rupert got his hand free and
it was the one which held the revolver. He fired at
random&mdash;three shots.</p>

<p>There was a shout in the distance: but at that
moment, the buccaneer seized him by the throat and
threw him down. Rupert with a strangled cry felt
himself being forced beneath the water, and thought
the end had come. He could hear the struggle
between Hwei and Tung-yu going on furiously, and
hear also very faintly the deep laughter of his
opponent. Then he lost consciousness. Everything
became dark, and Rupert's last thought was
that all his pains had been in vain. He would die,
and Olivia would be a widow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Fulfilled Prophecy</span></h4>


<p>When Rupert came to his senses, the surroundings
seemed to be familiar. He had lost consciousness
on the banks of the Thames, and during a fierce
struggle with a treacherous foe. He opened his
eyes to find himself in his own bed in his own room
at Royabay. But he felt strangely weak and
indisposed to talk. After a glance, he closed his
eyes again. Then, after what seemed to him to be
a few minutes&mdash;it was really half an hour&mdash;he
opened them again, and this time he saw Olivia
bending over him with an anxious face. "Dearest,"
he murmured weakly.</p>

<p>"Oh Rupert, do you know me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Where am I&mdash;what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"You are at the Abbey. Don't speak. Take
this," and some beef tea was held to his dry lips.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh drank a little and then fell asleep again.
When he did so there was an artificial light in the
room, but when he woke the sun was streaming in
through the window. But his wife was still beside
his bed, and still looked anxious. However, she
gave a little cry of joy when Rupert spoke in a
stronger voice. He was beginning to collect his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
scattered senses. "Have I been ill long?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Four days," she replied, "don't talk, darling."</p>

<p>"But the packet?"</p>

<p>"The Marquis has it safe."</p>

<p>"Burgh?"</p>

<p>"He has escaped. Don't talk."</p>

<p>"Miss Pewsey," said Rupert faintly.</p>

<p>"She is dead."</p>

<p>"Then Miss Pewsey <i>did</i> strangle your aunt."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;the doctor says you are not to talk."</p>

<p>"Just one more question. Those Chinamen?"</p>

<p>"Hwei and Tung-yu. They were drowned."</p>

<p>Rupert smiled weakly, and turning on his side
went off into a deep sleep. The doctor who called
later, said it was the best thing he could do. "He
has had a severe shock," said he to Olivia, "and his
nervous system is shaken. You may be thankful he
did not wake with a disordered brain."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, you don't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! No! It's all right. He would not have
asked those questions if anything was wrong with
his mind. In a few weeks he will be quite himself.
But I think, Mrs. Ainsleigh, that you should take
him abroad for a time."</p>

<p>Olivia gladly promised to do this, the more so, as
she wanted to escape herself from Marport for a
time. The news of Miss Pewsey's death had caused
a great sensation, and a still greater one was caused
by the publication in the paper of her crime. Everyone,
now knew that the bitter little woman had
strangled Miss Wharf, and everyone was very severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
on her. The funeral had to be conducted quietly,
as the mob showed signs of intending to interrupt.
However, the police kept back the irate crowd, and
Miss Pewsey was buried in a quiet corner of St.
Peter's church-yard, where a few weeks before, she
had hoped to be married. But her intended bridegroom
was in America, and Miss Pewsey's mortal
part was in the grave. Where her immortal soul
was and what would become of it, was talked over
by people, who were less forgiving than they ought
to have been.</p>

<p>Ainsleigh recovered his strength quicker then the
doctor thought he would. Olivia nursed him with
devoted tenderness, and often wept as she thought
how nearly she had lost him. When Rupert was
better able to hear the recital, she gave him a short
account of his rescue. "Those three shots you fired
brought up Rodgers and his men, who were searching
for Hwei and Tung-yu. They came, just in time to
pull Mr. Burgh off you. He was holding you down
under the water, and Mr. Rodgers thought you were
dead. However the doctor was called, and they
brought you round. Then I was telegraphed for,
and I insisted that you should be taken back to
Royabay. I had my way, although the doctor in
London said it would be dangerous. So here you
are, darling, in your own home, and soon will be all
right."</p>

<p>"Thanks to your nursing," said Ainsleigh, kissing
her, "but Olivia, tell me about Miss Pewsey."</p>

<p>"She made a confession before she died," said
Mrs. Ainsleigh, "oh Rupert, even though she is dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
I can't help saying, that she was a wicked little
woman."</p>

<p>"Wicked indeed," said Rupert, recalling what
Burgh had said, "she wished you to marry Burgh,
because he was married already."</p>

<p>"In which case he would have deserted me," said
Mrs. Ainsleigh with a crimson face, "he was as bad
as she. But listen, Rupert, if you feel strong
enough."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Ainsleigh, and held his wife's hand
while she talked.</p>

<p>"Well, then," began Mrs. Ainsleigh, "after the
Marquis pushed you out of the Penter's Alley room,
he went and got a doctor, who said that Miss Pewsey
was dying. She heard him, having regained her
senses, and then began to cry, saying how wicked
she had been. For the sake of everyone, Lo-Keong
asked her to make a confession. As soon as she
knew there was no hope of her recovery, she agreed
to do so. A clergyman was called in, and he took
down what she said. The confession was witnessed
and signed, and Mr. Rodgers has it."</p>

<p>"What did she confess?" asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"Oh," Olivia covered her face, "it was really awful.
She said that she was always jealous of Aunt Sophia,
and of me. She wished to get the five hundred a year.
At first she thought she would get it by marrying
me to her nephew, and then she could finger the
money, when my aunt died. But she soon saw that
I was not to be guided in the way she desired, and
cast about for a new plan."</p>

<p>"But, Olivia, if she knew Burgh was married&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that didn't matter to her. She intended he
should marry me and then if I got the money she
intended to say there was no marriage, unless I gave
her the five hundred a year. She wished to disgrace
me.</p>

<p>"A kind of blackmail, in fact."</p>

<p>"Yes. But I can't understand, how she intended
to reckon with Mr. Burgh, who is not an easy person
to deal with. Well Rupert, when she found that
I would not marry Mr. Burgh, she tried to get a new
will made. She did not succeed for a long time.
Meanwhile, she heard about the fan and wrote to
Lo-Keong. When she saw the advertisement she
was alarmed, thinking Aunt Sophia would be killed
before the new will was made. Luckily for her,
she overheard about our secret marriage and told
Aunt Sophia, who made a new will, and who intended,
after the ball, to turn me out of the house."</p>

<p>"But your aunt was so kind to you at that
time."</p>

<p>"So as to make things harder for me," said Olivia
sadly, "poor Aunt Sophia, she was quite under the
thumb of Miss Pewsey, who really did hypnotise her&mdash;at
least she confessed she had power over her in the
confession. But I don't think it was difficult to get
Aunt Sophia to alter her will, seeing she hated you
so, and could not bear to think that the five hundred
a year, should go to the son of the man, she thought,
had scorned her."</p>

<p>"That was not true: my father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! I know. Don't talk too much, Rupert
you are weak yet. But let me go on," added Olivia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
passing her hand over her husband's forehead.
"Well then, when the new will was made, Miss
Pewsey let Tung-yu know that Aunt Sophia would
have the fan at the ball. She didn't know whether
Tung-yu or Hwei was to kill the possessor of the
fan, and when she learned that Aunt Sophia was
to sell the fan next day, she was very angry."</p>

<p>"Why. With her influence she could have got
the money."</p>

<p>"Not all to herself, and besides she wanted the
five hundred a year, and Aunt Sophia out of the way.
Moreover, that scarf I knitted for you gave her a
chance of throwing the blame on you. She got
Clarence to get it, and then lured Miss Wharf&mdash;my
aunt&mdash;to the steps where she strangled her."</p>

<p>"Yes. Burgh told me. I know the rest. Her
nephew made her give up the fan, learned the secret,
and stole the packet. Then he made his aunt take
it to Penter's Alley."</p>

<p>Olivia nodded. "And Miss Pewsey thought she
would get the money, as Burgh said it was Tung-yu's
hour."</p>

<p>"So it was. He spoke truly enough, although
he didn't risk giving up the packet himself. Well."</p>

<p>"But Tung-yu killed Miss Pewsey after all. She
asked twenty thousand pounds and refused to give
it for less. Clarence Burgh who had come up with
her, came into the room with Hwei, who saw the
packet pass, but could not interfere."</p>

<p>"Because it wasn't his hour."</p>

<p>"Yes. And all would have been well, had not
Tung-yu suddenly disobeyed the god Kwang-ho's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
commands and stabbed Miss Pewsey. Of course,
Hwei was released from his oath by this act and
tried to get the packet. But Clarence Burgh
snatched it from both and ran away. Tung-yu went
after him, and then Hwei followed, after wiping the
knife. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know the rest. I got the packet from
Burgh."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he tried to drown you. Hwei and
Tung-yu were struggling together, as Tung-yu
wanted to get the packet from you. But Hwei
stabbed him with the same knife he had used to
kill Miss Pewsey, and in his death grip, Tung-yu
drew Hwei into the water. Both were dead and
still locked in each other's embrace when they
were drawn out. Lo-Keong said that Tung-yu deserved
his doom for having trifled with Kwang-ho,
but he mourns for Hwei."</p>

<p>"It seems to be much of a muchness," said Rupert,
"and Burgh?"</p>

<p>"Rodgers threw himself on him, and he was secured.
You were taken away, and I was telegraphed
for. But while Burgh was being taken to prison he
contrived to escape, and got away in the darkness."</p>

<p>"But Olivia, it was a bright, moonlight night."</p>

<p>"At first it was, but the moon set and darkness
came on. The police have been searching for Burgh,
but he has not been found, and it is supposed he has
got away from England."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Rupert with a shudder. "I
never wish to set eyes on him again. So that's the
end of it all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not quite. Lo-Keong is in the library with Mr.
Asher. Oh, Rupert, you must prepare yourself for
the best of news."</p>

<p>The young man rose, and was led downstairs by
his wife, "I am quite ready to hear the good news,"
he said, as they descended. "I have had far too
much bad news in my life."</p>

<p>As Olivia said, the lawyer was waiting in the
library, and stood before the fire with an expectant
face. Lo-Keong, in even more gorgeous robes than
he had worn on the occasion of his first visit, was
seated in his stately manner near the window. He
rose as the master of Royabay entered, and came
forward with a serious smile.</p>

<p>"My young friend," said the Mandarin. "I have
to thank you for saving my life. The papers which
would have ruined me, and which would have cost
me my head, have been burnt. Hwei is dead, and
Tung-yu; so no one but yourself knows what those
papers meant. My august mistress will never have
proof that I was engaged in the Boxer rebellion, and
Hop Sing will be degraded for ever."</p>

<p>"And you, Marquis?"</p>

<p>"I shall receive the yellow jacket," said the Mandarin,
proudly, "now I remain but a short time here.
I go to London in an hour, and this evening I leave
for the Continent on my way to China. We shall
never meet again Mr. Ainsleigh, unless you come to
Pekin."</p>

<p>"No," said Olivia, instinctively protecting Rupert,
"we have had enough of China, Marquis. Sit down,
Rupert."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>Ainsleigh took a chair, and the Marquis smiled
blandly. "Well, well, well," he said, "it is natural
you should feel rather nervous of my countrymen,
though I assure you, if you do visit me, that you will
be quite safe and highly honoured."</p>

<p>"No, thank you Marquis," said Rupert wearily,
for he was beginning to feel fatigued.</p>

<p>"I see you are tired," said Lo-Keong, in his
stately manner, "so I will merely say I hope to send
you some presents from my own country, and then
Mr. Asher can speak," he bowed to the solicitor.</p>

<p>"I am glad to tell Mr. Ainsleigh," said the lawyer,
"that the Marquis has handed me securities which
show that the sum of one hundred thousand pounds
is invested in your name. We can transfer the
securities to English investments if you like but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll leave them in Chinese," said Rupert quickly.</p>

<p>Lo-Keong bowed in a gratified manner. "You
will be wise," he said, "they are safe investments
and all my interest at the Imperial court, will go to
make you richer, if I can."</p>

<p>"You have done enough, Marquis," said Ainsleigh
gratefully, "you have given me back my old home."</p>

<p>"And we will be rich besides," said Olivia
delightedly.</p>

<p>"There's another thing," said Mr. Asher, looking
at the girl, "Miss Pewsey made a will in your favour,
Mrs. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>Olivia drew back with a red face. "Impossible!
She hated me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Asher dryly, "I expect she repented
of her evil deeds, or perhaps she hated her nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
more than she did you. That gentleman wrote
from a Continental address to Mr. Paster asking if
his aunt had left him the money as she promised. I
expect the address is a false one, as Mr. Burgh won't
wish to be caught."</p>

<p>"He is a bold man that," said Lo-Keong.</p>

<p>"He is," assented Asher, "but he won't benefit.
Mrs. Ainsleigh gets the five hundred a year, the freehold
of Ivy Lodge, and also the mortgage which Miss
Wharf bought to ruin Mr. Ainsleigh."</p>

<p>"We have everything&mdash;everything," cried Olivia.</p>

<p>"I am very thankful," said Rupert. "Mr.
Asher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll see you about the investments when you are
stronger," said the lawyer, "meanwhile here is the
carriage at the door. The Marquis is kind enough
to give me a lift," and Mr. Asher took his leave,
with a profound bow, to so opulent a client as
Rupert.</p>

<p>The Marquis Lo-Keong came forward with his
kind smile. "Before I wish you good-bye and all
happiness," he said, holding out the famous fan,
"will you take this?"</p>

<p>"No," said Olivia, preventing Rupert from accepting
it, "I hate the very sight of the thing. It has
blood on it."</p>

<p>"I think you are right, Mrs. Ainsleigh," said the
Chinaman gravely, "and, as it has done its duty, it
may as well go the way of the packet which now is
ashes," and advancing to the fire, he flung the fan
on the burning coals. It burst into a blaze, and in
a few minutes all had vanished save the slivers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
jade and the beads. The housemaid collected these
next morning and gave them to Olivia, who threw
them off the Marport pier. So that was the end of
the Mandarin's fan.</p>

<p>"And now," said Lo-Keong, bowing, "good-bye,
and great happiness to you both."</p>

<p>Rupert and Olivia shook hands warmly, and
thanked him heartily. The Mandarin walked out
of the room in his stately way, and they went to
the window to see him drive off. At the bend of the
avenue, he waved his hand graciously, and that was
the last the master and mistress of Royabay saw of
the man who had owned the fan.</p>

<p>A chuckle at the door made the couple turn from
the window. There, peering in, stood Mrs. Petley,
who had stuck with her husband to Rupert during
his troubles. Her face was shining, and old John
seemed to be years younger. Mrs. Petley, for some
queer reason, threw a shoe at the pair. "Health
and happiness," she said, "begging your pardons
both. But to think of money and happiness, and no
walking of that blessed monk, who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He never walked," said Rupert smiling, "it
was Hwei&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, sir, Hwei&mdash;whosoever he
is, didn't walk <i>all</i> the time. Abbot Raoul did
appear, as I can testify, and so can John here. But
now the prophecy has been fulfilled, perhaps he'll
rest quiet in his grave, drat him."</p>

<p>"The prophecy?" said Olivia, who was holding
her husband's hand.</p>

<p>From behind Mrs. Petley came the quavering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
voice of the ancient butler, declaiming the rude
rhymes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My curse from the tyrants will never depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a sword in the hands of the angel flashes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Ainsleigh poor, weds the poor maid of his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gold be brought forth from the holy ashes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And that's quite true," said a jovial voice, and
Major Tidman, as smart and stout as ever, entered.
"How do, Ainsleigh, I'm glad to see you looking so
well. Yes," he added, sitting down, "you <i>were</i>
poor Ainsleigh when you married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I was poor also," cried Olivia.</p>

<p>"Very good, the third line is fulfilled and the
fourth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was gold brought forth from the holy ashes?"
asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Rupert," said old John, "you
picked up the fan in the place where the ashes were,
and out of the fan has come gold. The prophecy is
fulfilled, sure enough, and I hope Abbot Raoul will
stop walking for ever."</p>

<p>"Of course he will," cried Mrs. Petley, dragging
her husband outside, "there's no more trouble for
you, Master Rupert and Miss Olivia."</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Ainsleigh, of Royabay," said
Tidman, laughing, "give them their proper titles,
Mrs. Petley. And I think the present occasion
deserves a bottle of port."</p>

<p>The ancient butler went away with his wife, to
bring forth one of the last bottles of that priceless
vintage. Major Tidman, gloating in anticipation,
sat still, and smiled with a bland face. But Rupert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
drew Olivia to the sofa, and they sat down where
they had often mourned on many a weary day.
"Dearest," said Ainsleigh, kissing her.</p>

<p>"We can be happy now," said Olivia putting her
arms round his neck, "for we are rich. We shall
take again our proper place in the county."</p>

<p>"We are rich and we are happy," echoed the
master of Royabay.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! You have one hundred thousand
pounds, Ainsleigh," said Tidman.</p>

<p>"I have something better."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"My own dear wife, Olivia Ainsleigh."</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
